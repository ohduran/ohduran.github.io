My name is Alvaro Duran-Barata. I am a problem solver, a curious mind, a lifelong learner.

### A brief history
- __2006__ As a high school student, I discover Physics for the first time.

It extends Mathematics to the everyday life, and aims to answer all those questions about the world we live in.

- __2009__ After disabusing myself from studying Philosophy, I get accepted as a Physics student.

It's the toughest challenge I have ever faced; leaning on my intellect is not going to cut. That's where I meet the smartest people I know.

- __2014__ During my senior year, one professor discusses the potential uses of mathematical tools for predicting stock prices.

That piqued my interest: so many questions unanswered, and a focus on "whatever works" regardless of the principles behind. So much work to do.

- __2015__ I accept a job offer in London after completing my master's degree in International Finance.

I will spend 3 years working in fintech companies, learning about the current trend in technologies and specialising in Data Science.

- __2018__ I move back to Spain.

I accept a position as a Software Engineer for a small SaaS company that deals with financial advisors.
