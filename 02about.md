I'm a software engineer based in Barcelona. I write mostly Python, either in Django or using its Data Science stack. I like TensorFlow, and haven't used Keras.

I work for a small startup that's working on automating bookkeeping for financial advisors. I've previously worked in London at a [Capco](https://capco.com/) and [Octopus Labs](https://octopuslabs.com/).

Before that, I studied Physics. I did a research project on [neutrinos](https://icecube.wisc.edu/info/neutrinos), a tiny subatomic particle that not so long ago was, although mistakenly, [observed to be faster than light](https://www.nature.com/news/2011/110927/full/477520a.html). After that, I earned my master's degree in International Finance.
