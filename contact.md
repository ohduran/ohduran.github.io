Ubiquitous email access has become engrained in our professional habits. As John Freeman warns in his book [The Tyranny of Email](https://amazon.com), with the rise of technology **we are slowly eroding our ability to explain - in a careful, complex way- why it is so wrong for us to complaint, resist, or redesign our workdays so that they are manageable**.

However, just because you cannot avoid email altogether doesn't mean I have to cede all authority over its role in my mental landscape.

Let me be clear: I want to talk to you. We can both benefit from talking to each other, pick each other's brains and learn from our experiences. Nevertheless, bear in mind the fact that I do my best to stay offline for most of my leisure time.

Most nonfiction authors are easy to reach: on Twitter and via email, both included on heir websites along with an open invitation to send them any request that comes to mind, arguing that this would help with their "community building".

In my case, I have reviewed a lot of people's CVs and code, and all in all have lots of meaningful conversations. On top of that, I had also wasted my time far too many times over an email conversation. If you have something worth telling me, please go ahead, I'll do my best to answer as soon as possible. Otherwise, think twice, regroup your thoughts, make time to compel a good case for why your email is worth reading and worth answering to. Or just don't send it: my default behaviour when receiving an email is to __not__ respond.

And don't take it personal: it's a sender filter. Like the one most big firms use in their applications, asking meaningless questions to their candidates so that, those who eventually apply are **really** committed to the job offer.

If you can do that, I will deliver an email that will be, to the best of my ability, the most efficient process for bringing your request to a successful conclusion. I aim at "closing the loop", trying to bring the conversation to an end as soon as possible, with you having an answer promptly and with me without something "on my plate".

### Generic Tips for Emailing Busy People

1. __Make specific questions, not vague requests__: Pretend you are talking to a busy colleague, and introduce your problem before anything else. Then help me understand what you tried, and how can I help you. If this sounds like [how you should ask a question on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask), it's because it is.

2. __Have a little patience__: I once read in [Algorithms to Live By](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Live-Computer-Science-Decisions/dp/1627790365) about ALOHAnet, and how it overcome interference by using what is called _Exponential Backoff_: double the potential delay before trying to transmit again. If I did not respond in one week, try again, and then wait two weeks.

3. __Don't use jargon with me__: I once worked at a financial services consultancy firm and the thing that I liked the least was people _pretending they know_. Help me understand, but also put your things together and avoid jargon at all costs. Start from the beginning, then drill down.

### Where you can find me
If we think alike, I want to hear about you. If we don't, I absolutely want to hear about you.
