*You can email me at __alvaro.duranb@gmail.com__. However, be aware that my default behaviour when receiving an email is to __not__ respond.*



When it comes to email, it's the sender responsibility to convince the receiver that a reply is worthwhile. Ubiquitous email access is engrained in our habits, and we have almost lost the ability to redesign our workdays so that we aren't reactive to notifications and emails.

However, I'm not going to give all authority over to my mobile to determine my mindset.

Let me be clear, __I want to talk to you__. We can both benefit from talking to each other. But I'm not 'building a community' here, and the likelihood of poorly thought emails to waste our time is tremendous. [We can do better](/2018/08/deep-work).

If you have something worth telling me, make time to compel a good case for why your email is worth considering and worth answering to, and __send it to me__. Or don't. This is actually a sender filter, like the one most big firms use in their job applications: ask meaningless questions to your candidates so that those who eventually apply are __really__ interested in the job offer.

Provided that you can do that, I will deliver an email that will be, to the best of my ability, the most efficient process for bringing your request to a successful conclusion. I'm bringing the conversation to an end as soon as possible, hence avoiding the back-and-forth email chains that come from poorly thought emails and leaving actionable feedback "on your plate".

### Generic Tips for Emailing Busy People

1. __Make specific questions, not vague requests__: Pretend you are talking to a busy colleague, and introduce your problem before anything else. Then help me understand what you tried, and how can I help you. If this sounds like [how you should ask a question on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask), it's because it is.

2. __Have a little patience__: I once read in [Algorithms to Live By](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Live-Computer-Science-Decisions/dp/1627790365) about ALOHAnet, and how it overcome interference by using what is called _Exponential Backoff_: double the potential delay before trying to transmit again. If I did not respond in one week, try again, and then wait two weeks.

3. __Don't use jargon with me__: I once worked at a financial services consultancy firm and the thing that I liked the least was people _pretending they know_. Help me understand, but also put your things together and avoid jargon at all costs. Start from the beginning, then drill down.
