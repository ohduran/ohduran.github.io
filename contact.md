I want to talk to you. Let me repeat it so that it is absolutely clear: I want to talk to you.

There are lots of reasons why I am not easily reachable, which are usually a linear combination of the following reasons:

- I spend most of my leisure time offline.
- I don't have any reason to have my phone buzzing, so I've turned my notifications off.

However, and I have said before, I want to talk to __you__. That's because I believe that everyone has an interesting story, and we can both benefit from talking to each other, pick each other's brains and learn from our experiences.

- __I like getting email__: I have never regretted getting an email. I have reviewed a lot of people's CVs and code, and all in all I have had lots of meaningful conversations. There is absolutely nothing you can do which will make me look down on you. I don't have an *Inbox Zero* policy, but I do my best to respond any email I get as soon as possible.

- __I like reading__: If there is one thing I like is reading. I'm usually short of things to read that interest me, so if you have something worth reading, please, __send it to me__. Again, the worst thing that can happen is that, for some reason, I don't get to see it immediately. I can't promise a fast response, but I can promise a thorough read.

- __I like going to Meetups__: If I am at a meetup of a conference, I aim at talking to people. I don't bite, ask me a question.

## Generic Tips for Emailing Busy People

1. __Make specific questions, not vague requests__: Pretend you are talking to a busy colleague, and introduce your problem before anything else. Then help me understand what you tried, and how can I help you. If this sounds like [how you should ask a question on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask), it's because it is.

2. __Have a little patience__: I once read in [Algorithms to Live By](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Live-Computer-Science-Decisions/dp/1627790365) about ALOHAnet, and how it overcome interference by using what is called _Exponential Backoff_: double the potential delay before trying to transmit again. If I did not respond in one week, try again, and then wait two weeks.

3. __Don't use jargon with me__: I once worked at a financial services consultancy firm and the thing that I liked the least was people _pretending they know_. Help me understand, but also put your things together and avoid jargon at all costs. Start from the beginning, then drill down.
