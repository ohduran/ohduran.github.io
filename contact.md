I want to talk to you. Let me repeat it so that it is absolutely clear: I want to talk to you.

There are lots of reasons why I am not easily reachable, which are usually a linear combination of the following traits of my personality:

- Although I have a [twitter account](www.twitter.com/oh_duran), I almost always never use it anymore. I do have Facebook, but, well, I also have a Tuenti account, mostly because everyone else has it, not because I use it oftenly.
- I spend most of my time offline.

However, and I have said before, I want to talk to __you__. That's because I believe that everyone has an interesting story, and we can both benefit from talking to each other, pick each other's brains and learn from our experiences.

- __I like getting email__: I have never regretted getting an email from a startup, engineer or student. I have helped a lot of people peer reviewing their CVs, reviewing their code and all in all having a meaningful conversation with them. There is absolutely nothing you can do which will make me look down on you. I don't have an *Inbox Zero* policy, but I do my best to respond any email I get as soon as possible.
- __I like reading__: If there is one thing I like, is reading. If you have something for me to read, please, __send it to me__. I will read it. Again, the worst thing that can happen is that, for some reason, I don't get to see it immediately. I'm curious by nature, and by default you have my undivided attention, so long as you have the patience with me to finish what I am doing at the moment (probably reading someone else's email, mind you).
- __I like going to Meetups__: If I am at a meetup of a conference, I aim at talking to people. I'm not a celebrity, and probably won't be unless a football scout finally signs me for their professional team. In any case, I don't bite.

## Generic Tips for Emailing Busy People

1. __Make specific questions, not vague requests__: Pretend you are talking to a busy colleague, and introduce your problem before anything else. Then help me understand what you tried, and how can I help you. If this sounds like [how you should ask a question on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask), it's because it is.
2. __Have a little patience__:I once read in [Algorithms to Live By](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Live-Computer-Science-Decisions/dp/1627790365) about ALOHAnet, and how it overcome interference by using what is called _Exponential Backoff_; that is, double the potential delay before trying to transmit again. If I did not respond in one week, try again, and then wait two weeks.
3. __Don't use jargon with me__: I once worked at a financial services consultancy firm and the thing that I liked the least was probably the illusion of knowledge of the people around me. Help me understand, but also put your things together and avoid jargon at all costs.
