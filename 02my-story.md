I'm a software engineer based in Barcelona, Spain. I write mostly Python, either in Django or using its Data Science stack: pandas, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, seaborn, Tensorflow...

I work for a small startup that's working on automating invoicing for financial advisors. In the evening, I mentor Data Science students at [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/). I spent 3 years in London working as a Digital Consultant at [Capco](https://capco.com/) and as a Data Scientist at [Octopus Labs](https://octopuslabs.com/).

My background is in theoretical Physics. I also hold a master's degree in International Finance.

I love teaching.
