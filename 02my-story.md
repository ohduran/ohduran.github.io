I'm a software engineer based in Barcelona, Spain. I write mostly Python, either in Django or using its Data Science stack.

I work for a small startup that's working on automating invoicing for financial advisors. In the evening, I mentor Data Science students at [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/). I spent 3 years in London working as a Digital Consultant at [Capco](https://capco.com/) and as a Data Scientist at [Octopus Labs](https://octopuslabs.com/).

My background is in theoretical Physics. I also hold a master's degree in International Finance.

I love teaching. And reading. That's why most of what you can read in this site is about what I've learnt reading and while working with software engineers, digital consultants, data scientists and students.

From time to time, I write light-reading posts that I include in [my journal](/index-journal.html). They may help you get to know me a little bit more, and you are welcome to start [from the beginning](/2017/05/pilot). However, most of my writing is focused on long form, slow burn [essays](/essays).
