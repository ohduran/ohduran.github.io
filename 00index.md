I'm a physicist with an MSc in Finance.

I've worked as a Digital Consultant and as a Data Scientist, and for companies like [Capco](https://www.capco.com/) and [Octopus Labs](https://octopuslabs.com/) in London.

Now I'm a Software Engineer based in Barcelona, while mentoring Data Science students at [Thinkful](https://thinkful.com).
