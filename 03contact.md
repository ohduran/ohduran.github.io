### I have something important you should know. What do I do?

If you have something worth telling me, make time to compel a good case for why your email is worth considering and worth answering to, and __please, send it to me__. Or think twice whether you have to, and save yourself some time by not sending it.

Consider this a spam filter, but more like the process most big firms use in their job applications: design a process with enough friction so that those candidates who eventually apply are *really* interested in the job offer.

Provided that you can do that, I commit myself to deliver an email that will be, to the best of my ability, the most efficient for bringing your request to a successful conclusion. I'm hence avoiding the back-and-forth email chains that come from poorly thought emails and leaving actionable feedback "on your plate".

### How do I send an email that prompts a response?

__Make specific questions, not vague requests__

Pretend you are talking to a busy colleague, and introduce your problem before anything else. Then help me understand what you tried, and how can I help you. If this sounds like [how you should ask a question on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask), it's because it is.

__Don't use jargon with me__

I once worked at a financial services consultancy firm and the thing that I liked the least was people _pretending they know_. Help me understand, but also put things together and avoid jargon at all costs. Start from the beginning, then drill down.

__Have a little patience__

[ALOHAnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALOHAnet) pioneered how to overcome interference by using what is called _Exponential Backoff_: double the potential delay before trying to transmit again. Apply the same principle: if I haven't responded in one week, try again, and then wait two weeks, then try again and wait four, and so on.
