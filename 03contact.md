### Why?
Ubiquitous email access is engrained in our habits, and we have almost lost the ability to redesign our workdays so that we aren't reactive to notifications and emails. However, I'm not going to give all authority over to my mobile to determine my mindset. When it comes to email, it's the sender responsibility to convince the receiver that a reply is worthwhile.

Let me be clear, __I want to talk to you__. We can both benefit from talking to each other. But the likelihood of poorly thought emails to waste our time is tremendous. [We can do better](/2018/08/deep-work).

### What do I do?

If you have something worth telling me, make time to compel a good case for why your email is worth considering and worth answering to, and __please, send it to me__. Or think twice whether you have to, and save yourself some time by not sending it.

Consider this a spam filter, but more like the process most big firms use in their job applications: design a process with enough friction so that those candidates who eventually apply are *really* interested in the job offer.

Provided that you can do that, I will deliver an email that will be, to the best of my ability, the most efficient process for bringing your request to a successful conclusion. I'm bringing the conversation to an end as soon as possible, hence avoiding the back-and-forth email chains that come from poorly thought emails and leaving actionable feedback "on your plate".

### How do I send an email that prompts a response?

__Make specific questions, not vague requests__ Pretend you are talking to a busy colleague, and introduce your problem before anything else. Then help me understand what you tried, and how can I help you. If this sounds like [how you should ask a question on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask), it's because it is.

__Don't use jargon with me__ I once worked at a financial services consultancy firm and the thing that I liked the least was people _pretending they know_. Help me understand, but also put your things together and avoid jargon at all costs. Start from the beginning, then drill down.

__Have a little patience__ I once read in [Algorithms to Live By](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Live-Computer-Science-Decisions/dp/1627790365) about ALOHAnet, and how it overcome interference by using what is called _Exponential Backoff_: double the potential delay before trying to transmit again. If I did not respond in one week, try again, and then wait two weeks.
