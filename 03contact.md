Make time to compel a good case for why your email is worth our time, and __please, send it to me__. Consider this a spam filter, but more like the process most big firms use in their job applications: with enough friction so that those candidates who eventually apply are *really* interested, and they aren't just [spraying and praying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spray_and_pray).

Such an investment in time comes with a promise: that I'll deliver a response that will be, to the best of my ability, the most efficient for bringing your request to a successful conclusion, avoiding further back-and-forth emails and leaving actionable feedback "on your plate".

### How do I send an email that prompts a response?

1. __Make specific questions, not vague requests__

    Pretend you are talking to a busy colleague, and introduce your problem before anything else. Then help me understand what you tried, and how can I help you. If this sounds like [how you should ask a question on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask), it's because it is.

2. __Don't use jargon with me__

    I once worked at a financial services consultancy firm and the thing that I liked the least was people _pretending they know_. Help me understand, but also put things together and avoid jargon at all costs. Start from the beginning, then drill down.

3. __Have a little patience__

    [ALOHAnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALOHAnet) pioneered how to overcome interference by using what is called _Exponential Backoff_: double the potential delay before trying to transmit again. Apply the same principle: if I haven't responded in one week, try again, and then wait two weeks, then try again and wait four, and so on.
