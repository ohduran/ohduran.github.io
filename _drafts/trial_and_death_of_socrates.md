Piety is doing as I am doing ; that is to say , prosecuting any one who is guilty of murder , sacrilege , or of any other similar crime — whether he be your father or mother , or some other person , that makes no difference — and not prosecuting them is impiety .

— I met a man who has spent a world of money on the sophists , Callias , the son of Hipponicus , and knowing that he had sons , I asked him : “ Callias , ” I said , “ if your two sons were foals or calves , there would be no difficulty in finding some one to put over them ; we should hire a trainer of horses , or a farmer probably , who would improve and perfect them in their own proper virtue and excellence ; but as they are human beings , whom are you thinking of placing over them ? Is there any one who understands human and political virtue ? You must have thought about this as you have sons ; is there any one ? ” “ There is , ” he said . “ Who is he ? ” said I ; “ and of what country ? and what does he charge ? ” “ Evenus the Parian , ” he replied ; “ he is the man , and his charge is five minae . ” Happy is Evenus , I said to myself , if he really has this wisdom , and teaches at such a modest charge . Had I the same , I should have been very proud and conceited ; but the truth is that I have no knowledge of the kind , O Athenians .

All this great fame and talk about you would never have arisen if you had been like other men :

Men of Athens , this reputation of mine has come of a certain sort of wisdom which I possess .

I will refer you to a witness who is worthy of credit , and will tell you about my wisdom — whether I have any , and of what sort — and that witness shall be the God of Delphi .

he went to Delphi and boldly asked the oracle to tell him whether — as I was saying , I must beg you not to interrupt — he asked the oracle to tell him whether there was any one wiser than I was , and the Pythian prophetess answered , that there was no man wiser .

When I heard the answer , I said to myself , What can the god mean ? and what is the interpretation of this riddle ? for I know that I have no wisdom , small or great .
Highlight (yellow) - Page 22 · Location 378
After long consideration , I at last thought of a method of trying the question . I reflected that if I could only find a man wiser than myself , then I might go to the god with a refutation in my hand .

When I began to talk with him , I could not help thinking that he was not really wise , although he was thought wise by many , and wiser still by himself ; and I went and tried to explain to him that he thought himself wise , but was not really wise ; and the consequence was that he hated me , and his enmity was shared by several who were present and heard me .

there is hardly a person present who would not have talked better about their poetry than they did themselves .

the truth is , O men of Athens , that God only is wise ; and in this oracle he means to say that the wisdom of men is little or nothing ; he is not speaking of Socrates , he is only using my name as an illustration , as if he said , He , O men , is the wisest who , like Socrates , knows that his wisdom is in truth worth nothing .

There is another thing : — young men of the richer classes , who have not much to do , come about me of their own accord ; they like to hear the pretenders examined , and they often imitate me , and examine others themselves ; there are plenty of persons , as they soon enough discover , who think that they know something , but really know little or nothing ;

instead of being angry with themselves are angry with me : This confounded Socrates , they say ; this villainous misleader of youth ! — and then if somebody asks them , Why , what evil does he practise or teach ? they do not know , and can not tell ; but in order that they may not appear to be at a loss , they repeat the ready - made charges which are used against all philosophers about teaching things up in the clouds and under the earth , and having no gods , and making the worse appear the better cause ; for they do not like to confess that their pretence of knowledge has been detected — which is the truth ; and as they are numerous and ambitious and energetic , and are all in battle array and have persuasive tongues , they have filled your ears with their loud and inveterate calumnies .

What do they say ? Something of this sort : — That Socrates is a doer of evil , and corruptor of the youth , and he does not believe in the gods of the state , and has other new divinities of his own .
Highlight (yellow) - Page 25 · Location 428
I say , O men of Athens , that Meletus is a doer of evil , and the evil is that he makes a joke of a serious matter , and is too ready at bringing other men to trial from a pretended zeal and interest about matters in which he really never had the smallest interest .
Highlight (yellow) - Page 25 · Location 430
Come hither , Meletus , and let me ask a question of you . You think a great deal about the improvement of youth ? Yes I do .
Highlight (yellow) - Page 25 · Location 434
Speak up , friend , and tell us who their improver is . The laws .
Highlight (yellow) - Page 26 · Location 445
Happy indeed would be the condition of youth if they had one corruptor only , and all the rest of the world were their improvers .

Now , is that a truth which your superior wisdom has recognized thus early in life , and am I , at my age , in such darkness and ignorance as not to know that if a man with whom I have to live is corrupted by me , I am very likely to be harmed by him , and yet I corrupt him , and intentionally , too ?
Highlight (yellow) - Page 27 · Location 456
But either I do not corrupt them , or I corrupt them unintentionally , so that on either view of the case you lie .
Highlight (yellow) - Page 27 · Location 460
But still I should like to know , Meletus , in what I am affirmed to corrupt the young . I suppose you mean , as I infer from your indictment , that I teach them not to acknowledge the gods which the state acknowledges ,
Highlight (yellow) - Page 27 · Location 463
tell me and the court , in somewhat plainer terms , what you mean ! for I do not as yet understand whether you affirm that I teach others to acknowledge some gods , and therefore do believe in gods , and am not an entire atheist — this you do not lay to my charge ; — but only that they are not the same gods which the city recognizes — the charge is that they are different gods .
Highlight (yellow) - Page 27 · Location 466
Or , do you mean to say that I am an atheist simply , and a teacher of atheism ?
Highlight (yellow) - Page 27 · Location 466
I mean the latter — that you are a complete atheist . That is an extraordinary statement , Meletus . Why do you say that ? Do you mean that I do not believe in the godhead of the sun or moon , which is the common creed of all men ? I assure you , judges , that he does not believe in them ; for he says that the sun is stone , and the moon earth .

For this fear of death is indeed the pretence of wisdom , and not real wisdom , being the appearance of knowing the unknown ; since no one knows whether death , which they in their fear apprehend to be the greatest evil , may not be the greatest good .

all these are ready to witness on behalf of the corruptor , of the destroyer of their kindred , as Meletus and Anytus call me ;

he who has experience of the manner in which we order justice and administer the state , and still remains , has entered into an implied contract that he will do as we command him . And he who disobeys us is , as we maintain , thrice wrong ; first , because in disobeying us he is disobeying his parents ; secondly , because we are the authors of his education ; thirdly , because he has made an agreement with us that he will duly obey our commands ; and he neither obeys them nor convinces us that our commands are wrong ; and we do not rudely impose them , but give them the alternative of obeying or convincing us ; — that is what we offer , and he does neither .

“ You , Socrates , are breaking the covenants and agreements which you made with us at your leisure , not in any haste or under any compulsion or deception , but having had seventy years to think of them , during which time you were at liberty to leave the city , if we were not to your mind , or if our covenants appeared to you to be unfair .

Think not of life and children first , and of justice afterwards , but of justice first , that you may be justified before the princes of the world below . For neither will you nor any that belong to you be happier or holier or juster in this life , or happier in another , if you do as Crito bids . Now you depart in innocence , a sufferer and not a doer of evil ; a victim , not of the laws , but of men . But if you go forth , returning evil for evil , and injury for injury , breaking the covenants and agreements which you have made with us , and wronging those whom you ought least to wrong , that is to say , yourself , your friends , your country , and us , we shall be angry with you while you live , and our brethren , the laws in the world below , will receive you as an enemy ; for they will know that you have done your best to destroy us . Listen , then , to us and not to Crito . ”

ECH . Were you yourself , Phaedo , in the prison with Socrates on the day when he drank the poison ? PHAED . Yes , Echecrates , I was .

“ For the eleven , ” he said , “ are now with Socrates ; they are taking off his chains , and giving orders that he is to die to - day . ” He soon returned and said that we might come in . On entering we found Socrates just released from chains , and Xanthippe , whom you know , sitting by him , and holding his child in her arms .

Then he , or any man who has the spirit of philosophy , will be willing to die , though he will not take his own life , for that is held not to be right .

There is a doctrine uttered in secret that man is a prisoner who has no right to open the door of his prison and run away ; this is a great mystery which I do not quite understand . Yet I too believe that the gods are our guardians , and that we are a possession of theirs .

For wars are occasioned by the love of money , and money has to be acquired for the sake and in the service of the body ; and in consequence of all these things the time which ought to be given to philosophy is lost .

Yet the exchange of one fear or pleasure or pain for another fear or pleasure or pain , which are measured like coins , the greater with the less , is not the exchange of virtue .

In what relates to the soul, men are apt to be incredulous; they fear that when she leaves the body her place may be nowhere.

Such was the end, Echecrates, of our friend, whom I may truly call the wisest, and justest, and best of all men whom I have ever known.
