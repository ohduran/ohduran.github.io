> In his book [The Innovators](https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Hackers-Geniuses-Created-Revolution/dp/1476708703), Walter Isaacson summarised Bill Gate's unique tendency toward depth as follows: _The one trait that differentiated [Gates from Allen] was focus. Allen's mind would flit between many ideas and passions, but Gates was a serial obsessor_.

[Deep Work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692) is the *professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit*. The book I'm talking about this time drills into what makes deep work value, in clear opposition to 'shallow work', which pervades our daily lives. Its author is Cal Newport, also author of [So Good they Can't Ignore You](https://www.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You/dp/1455509124/ref=pd_sim_14_1?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1455509124&pd_rd_r=62e5c976-ac8e-11e8-8742-1712fd196554&pd_rd_w=PYHhw&pd_rd_wg=MWemg&pf_rd_i=desktop-dp-sims&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_p=a180fdfb-b54e-4904-85ba-d852197d6c09&pf_rd_r=XW18WZ7NEDFFTYSAAZDV&pf_rd_s=desktop-dp-sims&pf_rd_t=40701&psc=1&refRID=XW18WZ7NEDFFTYSAAZDV) and was first published in the US in 2016 by Grand Central Publishing. This book argues that it is the ability to do deep work what sets apart great people like Carl Jung, Mark Twain, Woody Allen, J.K. Rowling, and, of course, Bill Gates, and that *the ubiquity of deep work among influential individuals is important to emphasize because it stands in sharp contrast to the behavior of most modern knowledge workers*.

Like [the Unabomber's manifesto](http://editions-hache.com/essais/pdf/kaczynski2.pdf), this is one of those books that affect the way you look at the world, one of those books that you cannot unread once you go through the last page: the Internet is highly addictive, there is no "I know better", and it's undermining our ability to produce high quality work. 'Deep Work' is *not some nostalgic affectation of writers and early-twentieth-century philosophers*, but an enlightener: take a moment to understand that you're constantly distracted, but so is everyone else.

Like any other professor, he always relies on "well cited" sources, and "influential books", which serves as a primer for an avid reader to go into those sources and go through the rabbit hole, so to say.

## Part 1: The Idea
In the first part of the book, the author develops what he calls "The Deep Work Hypothesis": *[That] the ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy*. He dedicates the first part of the book entirely to present arguments that will convince you that this hypothesis is true, like witnesses before the Grand Jury.

The first three witnesses are well known individuals that have achieved success in their work lives: Nate Silver, renowned by his election forecasts and his website [FiveThirtyEight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/); David Heinemeier Hansson, the creator of Ruby on Rails, one of the most famous Web development frameworks, *which currently provides the foundations for some of the Web's most popular destinations, including Twitter and Hulu* (also GitHub, Groupon and AirBnB); and John Doerr, a general partner in a VC firm called Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and *helped fund many of the key companies fuelling the current technological revolution*. These are the three personifications of what the author would call stars of our era, because they are personifications of three ways to achieve success in the foreseeable future where, as intelligent machine improves, there is little room for those who are just average workers.

Nate Silver represents the "high-skilled" workers. The development of technologies like data analytics, high-speed communications and rapid prototyping has increased the value of more abstract and data-driven reasoning, and the value of these kind of jobs. While this area touches particularly nearby, I can say that the drift is towards what the author says, but the hype is still bigger than the actual implementation (at least at the moment of reading), because most companies (even the bigger ones) haven't reached their full potential in terms of leveraging what their data can do.

However, the trend where average workers are no longer useful is clear and has prompted a public debate that is very often misleading (UBI, or Universal Basic Income, as a way to offset the job loss that we are "just about to witness", is the perfect example: we can address the skill gap in so many ways, but we are just going to copy a tiny subset of the things that Norway is doing, because they seem to be pretty cool overall).

The ace programmer David Heinemeier Hansson provides an example of what the author calls "the superstars". The advancement of high-speed data networks and collaboration tools have destroyed regionalism in many sectors of the knowledge work. It no longer makes sense for employers to confine themselves into local talent pool, because experts are within reach.

The final case is, as always, those who have the money, represented by John Doerr. As Tony Montana said, *in this country, you gotta make the money first. Then when you get the money, you get the power. Then when you get the power, then you get the women*. This is one of those moments in history when, unlike postwar Europe, it's a particularly good time to have access to capital: Instagram was sold for a billion dollars, while employing only 13 people. *With so little input from labor, the proportion of this wealth that flows back to the machine owners is without precedent*.

If quickly amassing capital is not within reach, the author lays down two core abilities for thriving in the New Economy:

1. Quickly master hard things - if you don't learn, you can't thrive.
2. Produce at an elite level in both quality and speed - if you don't produce, you won't thrive.

On the first one, to join the group of those who can work well with complicated topics, *requires that you hone your ability to master hard things*. This process of mastering hard things never ends: I recall, before going to college, having an interesting conversation with my father. 'Alvaro', he said, 'you're going to university, and you might think that you're close to the end of your education. Wrong: you're at the beginning'. He's 60, and still goes to conferences on his field (he's a dentist), so he practices what he preaches.

The author also attacks the absurdity of the new idea that exposure to screens would prepare children to succeed in the 21st century. *Giving students iPads or allowing them to film homework assignments on YouTube prepares them for a high-tech economy about as much as playing with Hot Wheels would prepare them to thrive as auto mechanics*.

Now consider producing at elite level: mastering is not enough. You must do something with it. The ability that sets David Hansson apart is not his unique ability to program computers well- you could argue that there are even better programmers at the theoretical level. He stands out because he leveraged this ability to unambiguously produce valuable and concrete results. Same for Nate Silver: he used to work with many statisticians during his time at Baseball Prospectus, but it was him alone who put the effort to adapt his analytical skills to the new and more lucrative territory of election forecasting.

And, yes, you guessed, these two core abilities depend on your ability to perform deep work. The author relies on the works of K. Anders Ericsson, renowned for his work on 'deliberate practice'
