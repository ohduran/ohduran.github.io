In his book [The Innovators](https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Hackers-Geniuses-Created-Revolution/dp/1476708703), Walter Isaacson summarised Bill Gate's unique tendency toward depth as follows: _The one trait that differentiated [Gates from Allen] was focus. Allen's mind would flit between many ideas and passions, but Gates was a serial obsessor_.

[Deep Work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692) is the book I'm talking about this time, and it builds into the *professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit*. Its author is Cal Newport, also author of [So Good they Can't Ignore You](https://www.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You/dp/1455509124/ref=pd_sim_14_1?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1455509124&pd_rd_r=62e5c976-ac8e-11e8-8742-1712fd196554&pd_rd_w=PYHhw&pd_rd_wg=MWemg&pf_rd_i=desktop-dp-sims&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_p=a180fdfb-b54e-4904-85ba-d852197d6c09&pf_rd_r=XW18WZ7NEDFFTYSAAZDV&pf_rd_s=desktop-dp-sims&pf_rd_t=40701&psc=1&refRID=XW18WZ7NEDFFTYSAAZDV) and was first published in the US in 2016 by Grand Central Publishing. This book argues that it is the ability to do what the author calls 'deep work' what sets apart great people like Carl Jung, Mark Twain, Woody Allen, J.K. Rowling, and, of course, Bill Gates, and that *the ubiquity of deep work among influential individuals is important to emphasize because it stands in sharp contrast to the behavior of most modern knowledge workers*.

Like [the Unabomber's manifesto](http://editions-hache.com/essais/pdf/kaczynski2.pdf), this is one of those books that affect the way you look at the world, one of those books that you cannot unread once you go through the last page: the Internet is highly addictive, there is no "I know better", and it's diminishing our ability to produce high quality work. It's not a luddist call, but an enlightener: take a moment to understand that you're constantly distracted, but so is everyone else.
