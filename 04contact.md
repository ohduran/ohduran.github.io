I'm a software engineer based in Barcelona, Spain. I write mostly Python, either in Django or using its Data Science stack.

I work for a small startup that's working on automating invoicing for financial advisors. In the evening, I mentor Data Science students at [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/).

I spent 3 years in London working as a Digital Consultant at [Capco](https://capco.com/) and as a Data Scientist at [Octopus Labs](https://octopuslabs.com/).

My background is in theoretical Physics. I also hold a master's degree in International Finance.

I love teaching. And reading.

### Why do you blog?

To keep track of my thinking process. I read things, then think about them, and finally document my research with a public post.

I wrote with the hope that other people may find it helpful in any way.

### Get in touch

Blogs are a two way conversation, so I welcome email and comments, as long as they're on topic, more or less. To get in touch, make time to compel a good case, and please [email me](mailto:{{ site.email }}) right away. I'll reply back only if I'm convinced that you are genuinely interested in having a conversation with me. Otherwise, [I may not be able to reply](/email).

Consider this a spam filter: there's enough friction so that those who eventually send an email have spent some time thinking about what to say, and they aren't just [spraying and praying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spray_and_pray) for my attention.

Such an investment in time comes with a promise: that I'll deliver a response that will be, to the best of my ability, the most efficient for bringing your request to a successful conclusion.

To send an email that prompts a response,

1. __Ask specific questions, not vague requests, [the John Skeet way](https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2010/08/29/writing-the-perfect-question/)__

2. __Don't use jargon with me, [use the Feynman Technique](https://fs.blog/2012/04/learn-anything-faster-with-the-feynman-technique/) instead__

3. __Have a little [patience](https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/10/22/conversations-with-kafka-love-patience/)__
