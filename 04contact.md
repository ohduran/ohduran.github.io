I'm a software engineer based in Barcelona, Spain. I write mostly Python, either in Django or using its Data Science stack.

I work for a small startup that's working on automating invoicing for financial advisors. In the evening, I mentor Data Science students at [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/). I spent 3 years in London working as a Digital Consultant at [Capco](https://capco.com/) and as a Data Scientist at [Octopus Labs](https://octopuslabs.com/).

My background is in theoretical Physics. I also hold a master's degree in International Finance.

I love teaching. And reading. That's why most of what you can read in this site is about what I've learnt reading and while working with software engineers, digital consultants, data scientists and students.

From time to time, I write light-reading posts that I include in [my journal](/index-journal.html). They may help you get to know me a little bit more, and you are welcome to start [from the beginning](/2017/05/pilot). However, most of my writing is focused on long form, slow burn [essays](/essays).

To contact me, make time to compel a good case, and please [email me](mailto:{{ site.email }}) right away. I'll reply back only if I'm convinced that you are genuinely interested in having a conversation with me.

Consider this a spam filter: there's enough friction so that those who eventually send an email have spent some time thinking about what to say, and they aren't just [spraying and praying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spray_and_pray) for my attention.

Such an investment in time comes with a promise: that I'll deliver a response that will be, to the best of my ability, the most efficient for bringing your request to a successful conclusion. If I think that your question may be helpful to others, I may write a post with the answer (with your permission).

To send an email that prompts a response,

1. __Make specific questions, not vague requests, like in [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)__

2. __Don't use jargon with me, [use the Feynman Technique](https://fs.blog/2012/04/learn-anything-faster-with-the-feynman-technique/) instead__

3. __Have a little [patience](https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/10/22/conversations-with-kafka-love-patience/)__
