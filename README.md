## Contributions

Although the design and implementation is mine, this site wouldn't have been possible without the following tools.

1. [ManyPixels](https://www.manypixels.co/) provided the illustrations for free for personal and commercial projects, without the need to include attribution.
2. [Z Creative Labs](https://www.zcreativelabs.com/) provided the characteristic waves that define the site. You can explore the tool they've built for this on [getwaves.io](https://getwaves.io)
3. [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) provides the backend for the contact section.
4. The Logos on the Companies I've partnered with are the property of their respective owners.
