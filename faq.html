<h3>The short version</h3>
<p class="pb-3">I've been a Digital Consultant, a Data Scientist and a Software Engineer. I was born in Madrid, been living in London for 3 years, and I'm currently in Barcelona.</p>

<h3>The long version</h3>
<p class="pb-3">You can find it in <a href="/about">my story</a>.</p>

<h3>Should I learn how to code?</h3>
<p>It depends. Code is just a language, a particular one by which you communicate things to the computer. You may learn how to give it orders, but in the end it will do exactly as you tell it. True mastery comes from understanding how a computer works. For starters, read <a href="/code">Code, The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software</a>, by Charles Petzold.</p>
<p class="pb-3">On the other hand, there are so many professions that are going to be affected by technology— or are in the process— that is unlikely that anyone will be able to do without some basic coding skills in the foreseeable future.</p>

<h3>How do you monetise this site?</h3>
<p>I'm lucky. I don't depend on the income being generated by this website to make a living. You won't find <a href="/writing-in-times-of-clickbait">clickbait</a>, nor ads on this site. Affiliate revenues come from Amazon: when you buy a book via any link on this site, I collect a small commission.</p>
