Once you have an idea popping in your head, the first thing you have to do is to pitch it.
To whomever. "Gee, I had this crazy idea for a startup where..." and off you go. Describe the bird's eye view of it,
and then stop. Wait for a reaction. Most people think that crafting the elevator pitch is an important part of selling,
but I digress: the most valuable part is having something good enough to be pitched.

Often, the worst critics seem to be your circle of trust; the universe is simply indifferent.
They fear for your enthusiasm, your obsession; you're deprioritising them. Stephen King is fond of saying
that friends and lovers lie endlessly, caught in a web of duty, but in the end you can see through their
well-meaning words whether the idea is good enough.

It's a good thing, though. The vital part of being productive is figuring out early what not to work on.
The elevator pitch is exactly for that purpose: it saves everyone's time.

But if the idea is good, if people can see it in motion, if they can see the benefit to people, the value added,
what have you. If you hit on something, it's time you roll up your sleeves and get to work.
