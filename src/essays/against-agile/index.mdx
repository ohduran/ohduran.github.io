The [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) is an immune response on the part of programmers to bad management.

The very people that nowadays would have signed a similar manifesto are not present in any Agile conference. On the contrary,
it's [the snake oil managers](https://www.agile-academy.com/en/agile100/) the ones that give the keynote speeches.

In many organizations, the Scrum Master, the one purportedly tasked with ensuring that the delivery achieves high standards,
is not technical. The one person responsible for conceptual integrity doesn't even know how to code.

Agile seems to have become the fad that it purposedly try to avoid becoming. The one with Power Point presentations, guys wearing ties,
and unsplash pictures of people shaking hands.

The principles of agile have been weaponized for the convenience of control freak, non-technical individuals for whom the
task of supervising people with a complete different expertise is unsurmontable. IT projects still FAIL at an alarming rate.

Prioritization, Pragmatism, DYNAMISM.

Agile must be the most overused and misused buzzword in IT management. By a landslide.

WAIT. It's not me, it's Andy Hunt: https://toolshed.com/2015/05/the-failure-of-agile.html

Science isn't a coherent body of knowledge; it's like a body of law. Fully contradictory,
and the only way to advance is through persuasion. Like in front of a jury.
