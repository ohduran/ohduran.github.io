###### This is going to get very technical very soon. You've been warned.

It all started with this issue on Github:

  Is there is any way we can we can import different CSS file for different
  pages?

For the last couple of months I have been chewing away at [Getting Out of Our Ruts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreccgYLfx8).
I'm especially mindful of how everything online is [the same](http://www.novolume.co.uk/blog/all-websites-look-the-same/), and this video just confirms that there's people out there
who have been saying just that for quite a while now.

You may think that the massive opportunity for **uniqueness** would force a more diverse layout scene. And yet, even with
a massive theme market, creators _mimic the best sellers_ to make money, adding to the fluff, because you're not going to
earn a living by going out on a limb and creating something truly original. Generic wins out every time.

On the other side of the aisle, clients have of course noticed, and are even asking for this rudimentary designs. They see
lots of sites with that style, and it’s causing them to ask for it. You have to be very brave as a business owner to take
the risk of looking different. The mouth says "unique" but the wallets shout "just like everyone else".

Someone has even wrapped up this trend into [a framework](http://designmodo.com/startup/), so now you can conform even quicker than ever!

But, see, the problem with the way Gatsby projects (such as this website) are setup is that styling is usually shared across the whole site. Titles
have this font size, this or that colour, or are underlined/italised, and so on.

This is usually very helpful— I don't want to painstakingly define how everything should look like again and again, and I'd rather
have consistency— but not always. Sometimes, I want a specific part to be specifically styled.

If this is going to _truly_ become my artistic [playground](https://colly.com/articles/this-used-to-be-our-playground), then I thought it might be helpful to share some of my crazy ideas
and slowly but surely sharp my skills as well as set the tone, feel, and artistic style for my projects. But at the same time, I don't want
these experiments clashing with what I've previously posted[^1].
