This is going to get very technical very soon. It all started with this issue on Github:

  Is there is any way we can we can import different CSS file for different
  pages?

For the last couple of months I have been chewing away at [Everything You Know About Web Design Just Changed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBwBACbRuGY).
Driven by a desire to try new things and experiment with new ideas and tools, I've decided to spin a small experiment from
time to time, a self-contained spark of invention or simply a shameless copy of what I've seen somewhere, adapted within the
limitations of my own technique.

But, see, the problem with the way Gatsby projects (such as this website) are setup is that styling is usually shared across the whole site. Titles
have this font size, this or that colour, or are underlined/italised, and so on.

This is usually very helpful— I don't want to painstakingly define how everything should look like again and again, and I'd rather
have consistency— but not always. Sometimes, I want a specific part to be specifically styled.

If this is going to _truly_ become my artistic [playground](https://colly.com/articles/this-used-to-be-our-playground), then I thought it might be helpful to share some of my crazy ideas
and slowly but surely sharp my skills as well as set the tone, feel, and artistic style for my projects. But at the same time, I don't want
these experiments clashing with what I've previously posted[^1].

[^1]: Nor do I want to check everytime I do something stupid. There are limits on my ability to test, and there is always someone somewhere ready to spot a mistake.
