For the last couple of months I have been mulling over Jen Simmon's [Getting Out
of Our Ruts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreccgYLfx8). I've [noted before](./beyond-minimalism)
of how everything online is [the same](http://www.novolume.co.uk/blog/all-websites-look-the-same/),
and her talk just confirms that there's been people out there saying just that for quite a while now.

You may think that a huge opportunity for **uniqueness** would force a more diverse layout scene. And yet, even with
a massive theme market, creators _mimic the best sellers_ to make money, adding to the fluff, because they're not going to
earn a living by going out on a limb and creating something truly original. Generic wins out every time.

On the other side of the aisle, clients have of course noticed, and are even asking for these rudimentary designs. They see
lots of sites with that styles, and it’s causing them to ask for them too. You have to be very brave as a business owner to take
the risk of looking different. The mouth says "unique" but the wallets shout "just like everyone else".

In an effort to do something different with my site, I've been tinkering away at ways to be less predictable with it, and
I ended up realising something very interesting: **creating pages with different styles is hard**.

The main problem with the way Gatsby projects (such as this website) are setup is that styling is usually shared across the whole site. Titles
have this font size, this or that colour, or are underlined/italised, and so on. If you are just testing the waters with Gatsby,
the tutorial simply [nudges you into having one general CSS file for your whole project](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-two/).

That in itself isn't bad. I have to remind myself constantly that _what I'm trying to do is a path followed by very few people_.
Having a global styling file is usually very helpful— most people don't want to painstakingly define how everything should look like
again and again, and rather have consistency.

By making many decisions for you —beware of the "opinionated frameworks"—, the amount of work needed to overrule those decisions
increases with every level of abstraction. Since enough people are asking for it, web development frameworks are making it
extra difficult to do one-off things, dialing up the convenience at the expense of flexibility and variety.

Hence, I decided that if this site is _truly_ going to become my artistic [playground](https://colly.com/articles/this-used-to-be-our-playground),
then I thought it might be helpful to share some of my crazy ideas, sharp my skills and set the tone, feel, and artistic style for my projects.
But at the same time, I don't want these experiments clashing with what I've previously posted[^1].

Perhaps I'm alone in this. But in any case, I figure that it could be helpful to document what I found out about tweaking
Gatsby for my unconventional desire to do away with consistency.

## Templating

## Isolated Styling with CSS Modules

The simplest way to isolate CSS and avoid conflicting styles across your site is [using CSS modules](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/styling/css-modules/).
It solves the problem of isolation not by restricting the scope of the styles, but by _making sure that name collision in
the styling classes never happen_.
