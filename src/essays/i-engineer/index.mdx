I.

I work in a nascent industry. My bachelor had nothing to do with it, and I never earned a certification that made me qualified for it.
My only real obstacle between me and writing software that would be used by real world people was a whiteboard interview.
I am though, in some sense of the word, and engineer.

Ironically, I recall glaring at engineers with contempt in university. We were _physicists_, and there was this notion that physicists
developed the equations that the engineers used to design the edifices. We considered ourselves the secret of humanity's success,
the triumph of thought, and tomorrow's unsung heroes. And it has taken me several years to realise that this notion is simply false.
It's just that engineers get sandbagged by historians.

In a research paper called [Urgency, uncertainty, and innovation: Building jet engines in postwar America](https://sci-hub.st/10.1177/1744935906064096),
Phil Scranton showed that jet engines have been designed in a completely trial-and-error manner, without anyone truly understanding the theory underneath.
Builders, in fact, needed the first engineers to know how to twist things and make the engine work. Theory is a byproduct<sup>1</sup>.<p class="sidenote"><sup>1</sup> I became aware of this story while reading Nassim Taleb's <em>Antifragile</em>.</p>
Scranton was polite enough to point out that this arises when innovation is messy, and made a distinction between that and
"_more familiar analytic and synthetic innovation approaches_", almost insinuating that the latter are the norm. They're not.

In _The Knowledge Machine_, author Michael Stevens argues that there's something different about ancient Greece and modern times,
and that is "the knowledge machine that we call modern science". It's hard to object to the fact that ancient Greeks did not have MRIs
or means of transport faster than horses, but the idea that we have modern science and they didn't seems too binary to me.
Romans were able to make [the Lycurgus cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycurgus_Cup), something that today would require
electron microscopes to understand what is going on at a functional level. Anybody who build things for a living as oppose
to just writing about them knows that you do not get a cup that shows a different colour depending on whether or not
light is passing through it without an extenuating process of iteration and refinement. You might guess that there
was some inicial accident that ignite the whole process, but engineering a result this good takes a long time. That is something
that the 400 AD Romans had; and it's not conceptually different from the jet engine.

I'm not denying the possibility that academic science isn't behind some practical technologies at all, what Joel Mokyr calls _epistemic base_,
a sort of fundamental set of knowledge facts that are used to derived everything else (Heisenberg's realisation that quantum mechanics
can be formulated using matrices comes to mind<sup>2</sup>).<p class="sidenote"><sup>2</sup> The wikipedia entry on [Heisenberg's entryway to matrix mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenberg's_entryway_to_matrix_mechanics) is especially insightful.</p>

There is a body of know-how that was transmitted from master to apprentice, and _only_ in such a manner, and the role of
formal knowledge is overappreciated precisely because it is highly visible.
