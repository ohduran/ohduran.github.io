I.

This is my essay, so I'm going to ask a question, and come what may:

<p class="text-center">Do you remember Game of Thrones?</p>

In interviews, George R.R. Martin, author of the adapted novels, compared himself to a gardener. Instead of detailed outlines,
he favours the opportunities that spring up in the writing process. You start writing, read back and nurtrure it.
This _feels_ right: as a writer-gardener, you are only concern with getting rid of what's weed and let the rest grow,
and an important quality of growth is that the significant moments are often unanticipated. But, by gardening, the author may end up
in a difficult position where all of that branching makes the reader slug through the story.

On the other hand, you have, let's say, "The Architect"â€” one who writes detailed outlines for plots and believes in the necessity of structure.
This approach should feel familiar: you may have met The Architect in the latest documentation you read, or in the last
Scrum masterclass you attended. It's how modern work happens because architectural writing is easier to do in groups and _hedges against risk_.
That said, it can be hard to stay interested if it feels like you're painting by numbers. Sometimes you load up a show on Netflix and you can feel the algorithm in it.

This can't be delineated so clearly, of course, but everyone sits somewhere in the gardener-architect spectrum.
