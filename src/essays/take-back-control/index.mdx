summary: Tools are meant to be owned, not rented.

It just feels natural because it is: you get up in the morning on your bed, have your breakfast, wear your clothes. We live surrounded by things we own.
But ownership is nothing more than a form of restricted freedom: everyone else acts as if they believed that it's not OK to just crash your door and get
to use the coffee machine that's sitting on top of the kitchen table. Even though they could, if they tried to. Society is organised and is functional because
we have defined the terms in which someone "owns" things, and it has been working fine for a long time.

Until pretty much the invention of means to sell intellectual property, that is.

In 1980, Richard Stallman and some other software engineers at the AI Lab (under the umbrella of MIT University) were frustrated by the fact that they just could
not tinker with the software that ran the Xerox 9700 laser printer that they had. They owned it (or at least the MIT had paid for it), and yet, they could not do
as they pleased with it. It's as if you were sold a bottle of wine that could only pour in crystal glasses. For physical objects, the fact
that something is in your posession, under your control, means **complete control**: they might refuse to help you if you break it, but as far as you're concerned,
there's nothing that's stopping you from looking under the hood.

This experience was what convinced Stallman of people's need to be free to modify the software they use. That is, he believed that society should treat intellectual
property as if it were physical: control is either _complete_, once purchased, or it isn't control at all.

Ah, but there's an obvious point to be made: software isn't physical. It's not _stuff_, in the sense that there are no limits to your ability to copy paste it endlessly<sup>1</sup>. <p class="sidenote"><sup>1</sup> Thanks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Tesler">Larry Tesler</a>.</p> The economics of redistribution is the first thing that goes out the window, because it used to be prohibitively expensive to buy something, figure out how to make it, and turn around and find people to sell it to. Non-physical properties do not operate under that paradigm.

But, then, in what paradigm do they operate?

In 1995, CD sales peaked. As soon as a cheaper means to transmit music became widespread, forcing people to buy circular plastic only because it contained the combination
of sounds you wanted to hear wasn't a viable business anymore. And that cheaper means was the relentless copy machine we call The Internet.

I know it's sort of an obvious thing to say, but humour me: the Internet changed everything. There is virtually nothing physical anymore, if you come to think about it.
Unlike the mass-produced businesses of an old era, there is simply no way to approach a market just by showing up: everyone is just one click away. Copies of what you
sell are not just Made-in-China cheap; they are Designed-in-California free.

And yet, we still think that what we sell is unique in some way. As if that mattered. As if there wasn't a kid that speaks just good enough broken English to do what you do
better, faster, and for peanuts. As if the guys who invented the Xerox 9700 that Stallman wanted to tinker with were still around. As if [Google](https://opensource.google/)
or [Facebook](https://opensource.facebook.com/projects), or [Microsoft](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-microsoft-and-google-are-now-leading-the-open-source-revolution/) of all places,
weren't furiously churning tools to accelerate this everything-is-free trend even more.

Everything is free. Free as in "you don't pay anything upfront". But not "free as in 'free beer'".

There's a [remarkable moment in The Mentalist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIQmbjUngf0&t=1m20s) where the star character offers advice on how to seduce a woman.
"Seduction is easy once you know the basic principles". And then, he says: _It'll cost you a dollar, so you pay attention_. It's the perfect metaphor of how
informational products are sold online: there's the platitude, followed by the sale. The platitude is free; it's a form of marketing and proof of credentials: it's as important
to say something true as it is for it to be just actionable enough and said in a confident way, leaving you curious.

Again and again, we keep on mistaking the platitude for the product. Google isn't a search engine. It sells ads. Search results are the bait.
The Internet is what transmits the platitude at lightning speed to global audiences. What you do with that is what cannot be replicated. What's free
on the Internet is not beer; it's "the first one is free".
