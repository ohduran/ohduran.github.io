summary: Tools are meant to be owned, not rented.

It just feels natural because it is: you get up in the morning on your bed, have your breakfast, wear your clothes. We live surrounded by things we own.
But ownership is nothing more than a form of restricted freedom: everyone else acts as if they believed that it's not OK to just crash your door and get
to use the coffee machine that's sitting on top of the kitchen table. Even though they could, if they tried to. Society is organised and is functional because
we have defined the terms in which someone "owns" things, and it has been working fine for a long time.

Until pretty much the invention of means to sell intellectual property, that is.

In 1980, Richard Stallman and some other software engineers at the AI Lab (under the umbrella of MIT University) were frustrated by the fact that they just could
not tinker with the software that ran the Xerox 9700 laser printer that they had. They owned it (or at least the MIT had paid for it), and yet, they could not do
as they pleased with it. It's as if you were sold a bottle of wine that could only pour in crystal glasses. For physical objects, the fact
that something is in your posession, under your control, means **complete control**: they might refuse to help you if you break it, but as far as you're concerned,
there's nothing that's stopping you from looking under the hood.

This experience was what convinced Stallman of people's need to be free to modify the software they use. That is, he believed that society should treat intellectual
property as if it were physical: control is either *complete*, once purchased, or it isn't control at all.

Ah, but there's an obvious point to be made: software isn't physical. It's not *stuff*, in the sense that there are no limits to your ability to copy paste it endlessly<sup>1</sup>. <p class="sidenote"><sup>1</sup> Thanks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Tesler">Larry Tesler</a>.</p> The economics of redistribution is the first thing that goes out the window, because it used to be prohibitively expensive to buy something, figure out how to make it, and turn around and find people to sell it to. Non-physical properties do not operate under that paradigm.

But, then, in what paradigm do they operate?
