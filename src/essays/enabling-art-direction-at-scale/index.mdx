Design systems are simply an effort to replicate what engineers have been doing with code for a long time: to make their
work functional, reusable, extensible, and version controlled. The distance from Figma to Javascript is apparently filled
by a gigantic moat, and that's because, regardless of the quality of the design, the end result is always _the implemented product_.

This is tricky, because no matter how much design comes into place, in the end there's always a back-and-forth with the client
that, in my experience, is **very frustating** to the engineering team. This abstract game of tennis, in which designer
and client smash ideas into the other player's court, takes a toll on the ballboys[^2]. When it comes to the code, many designers
have a "end-justify-the-means" mentality that puts the maintenance of a codebase to the test.

I'm an engineer, and this is my site: a well-organized codebase is, I believe, the kind of tool that paves the way for
making updates and improvements.
