### Working on a new company

It's called [EdgeTier](https://edgetier.com), and they provide AI capabilities to contact centers. I've been working there remotely since December 2020 as a Backend Software Engineer.

### Reading _Notes on the Synthesis of Form_, by Christopher Alexander

> We must face the fact that we are on the brink of times

> Again, as then, our innocence is lost. And again, of course, the innocence, once lost,

### Learning how to use Anki

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is a flashcard programme. I used to put very little emphasis on memory
(I used to bring a cheatsheet with me to my exams back in the days), and only recently I became curious about
how memory works, and whether it is just an outdated skill in the age of search engines (Short answer: No).

I picked up _Moonwalking with Einstein_ and _How to Develop a Brilliant Memory Week by Week_ but it wasn't engaging enough for me to keep at it.
After reading _Peak_ and finding out that skills are domain specific (that is, you don't have good memory "generally", but only for particular domains),
my interest on memorising decks of cards have been declining.

So, yeah, Anki is now my go-to tool for learning new things. Everything I read goes through it (research papers, books, and so on).

### Learning to (really) play chess

As part of learning how to use Anki, I picked up, like [millions of others](https://nypost.com/2020/11/23/the-queens-gambit-cause-chess-set-sales-to-surge/) apparently,
chess. I started with the very basics, and I am now taking lessons from a WIM called [Bianka Havanecz](https://lichess.org/@/chessbia).

If you find yourself in a similar boat, feel free to [challenge me on chess.com](https://play.chess.com/YuaXk).

### Don't find me on social sites. I'm simply not there.

That is indeed the case for the book of faces and the blue angry bird. I'm unfortunately locked in on Whatsapp,
but I'm trying something different lately that I hope it catches on: üì¨‚úâÔ∏èüí® snail mail.

I plan on send to several people in my inner circle an unexpected letter, and see where that gets me.
