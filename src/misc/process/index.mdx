Most temporary things end up being more permanent than initially predicted. So, even if it is not complete, this is an
effort to articulate how I work, and what to expect.

## My job is to tell you what _not_ to do

Both design and engineering is all about finding ways to systematise what options to rule out, what
mistakes not to make, and what trails not to walk.

Engineering feels to me as the removal of options; the white paper, like white light, contains all the
possibilities, and as soon as you start writing, it's as if you're playing **a game of chess**: the avoidance of mistakes turns
out to be the best system towards the best moves.

## Systems create the freedom we need

There's this notion that in order to increase wealth, we have to work harder. That has been wrong for the past 200 years,
since the invention of the steam engine, and the advent of computers has only made this notion even more wrong. The role
of technology is to [increase profits without incurring in more costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_factor_productivity).
The central assumption of my strategic assessment is finding ways to make people more productive, leveraging software.

## Nothing worthwile costs nothing

There is nothing free as in "free beer". Just because there are no salient costs doesn't mean that you won't end up paying
for the decisions you make.
