I learnt how to program very late— not until I was an undergraduate—, and my first encounter with code was ugly.
I was used to a blackboard, and formulas, and developing software was very alien.
I'd much rather had written sophisticated equations on a piece of paper than fix trivial code on a computer screen.

It wasn't until I was working in London that I was taught how to program well, using modern tools.
And it was then, working in a digital banking project, when I encountered for the first time a problem that's been my obsession ever since.

## Why is it so hard to do simple things with software once it grows too complex?

It was absurd that moving information from Subsystem A to Subsystem B in a simple,
scalable way required 4 teams distributed in 4 different countries. Just as absurd as the fact that this distribution was essential,
because the project required hiring people with skills so specific, they couldn't be found in just one city.

The implications are profound. There's this notion that progress is inevitable, but my experience has been that we have stopped being able to do the things that we used to.
That the productivity of software developers seems to be in decline, and I fear for a time when it simply stops.

This site, and the writing it contains, is an attempt to build the knowledge tools to understand why this is happening, and how to fix it.
