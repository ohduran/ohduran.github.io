# Biography

I was born in Madrid in 1991. My parents said that I started reading very early, and haven't stopped ever since.
From the beginning I've found very pleasurable just to sit somewhere peaceful, comfortable, and read. It was often a nuisance for those around me.

After graduating in Physics, I pursued a Master's degree in Finance, and got hired as a consultant in London. During my first 'real' job outside of school,
I truly learn how to manage my time, and how to develop software. Being surrounded by PhDs reminded me that, in order to thrive in an ever-changing world, I need to stay sharp, and learn new things.

I work from beautiful Barcelona. I am getting married this summer, and I am lucky enough to say I'm happy.
