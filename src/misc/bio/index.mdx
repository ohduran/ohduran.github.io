I was born in Madrid in 1991. My parents said that I started reading very early,
and haven't stopped ever since.
From the beginning I've found very pleasurable just to sit somewhere peaceful, comfortable, and read.

My most successful hack on a non-computer system happened on my last term as a Physics undergraduate.
My end of bachelor thesis revolved around [neutrino oscillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino_oscillation),
which is a research area that overlaps with astronomy, particle physics, and quantum mechanics.
I manage to reuse the same notes to put together the three presentations that I had to do on those three subjects.
It wasn't the first time that I bend the system rules to my advantage, and it wouldn't be the last.

After graduation, I pursued a Master's degree in Finance, and got a job as a digital consultant in London.
My first _real job_ outside of university was as a Business Analyst for a top tier global bank,
and the truth is that my job was as unengaging as it may sound. I acted as a liaison between the project management office
and the developer team. Why did they need a liaison in the first place, I honestly don't know. But that allowed me to truly see
what the financial industry is made of. And it isn't beautiful.

It was the first time that I bumped into systematic related problems.

After that, I worked for a while as a Data Analyst, and eventually as a Software Engineer.
I see the world through the lens of a complicated problem: that software is making the world very fragile.

I work from beautiful Barcelona.
