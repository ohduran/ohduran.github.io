In the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, an *indulgence* is one way to reduce the amount of punishment one has to undergo for sins. It's what in financial markets can be considered an option: hedging against a future cost, you pay a fee in present time. The recipient of an indulgence must do something in exchange for it; usually, praying, or visiting a particular place. Catholicism is highly individualistic: you, and only you, have control over what awaits you when you meet your Maker. Indulgences is the exchange of your moral assets to pay for your moral liabilities.

Stretching it, indulgences can be paid with money. This led to abuse during the Middle Ages, and it became one of the main methods employed to finance the building of St. Peter's Basilica in what is now Vatican City, the papal enclave within the city of Rome.

How could someone believe that giving money to a priest would reduce your eventual time on Purgatory?

*How could they not?* Hundreds of years of routinely giving away money to the Church, the rich  and the poor alike, made monetary indulgences a valuable good, and in turn a reliable source of funds for the popes that supersede the works at St. Peters for 120 years. It was meant to be, because priests were attention merchants.

Communication is, as we discussed in [Language in Thought and Action](/language-in-thought-and-action), what makes progress possible.

> If someone shouts at you, “Look out!” And you jump just in time to avoid being struck by a car, you owe your escape from injury to the fundamental cooperative act [of communication by means of noises]. […] You had, for the time being, the advantage of an extra nervous system in addition to yours.

Since the rise of civilisation, it has been known that capturing someone's attention could also be used to capture some of his money. Theatres in the Ancient Greek and Roman era— [are you not entertained?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbBiXPVKuTA&app=desktop)— gave way to *troubadours* and animal fights. But this form of mental fodder was thought as an exchange: you are amused, and in return you give me some money. Check out your closest tourist area: there's likely someone acting out a performance in exchange for a tip.

Real breakthrough came when someone stopped seeing the masses as numerous clients, and started seeing them as an attractive product to sell. That someone was Benjamin Day, who in 1833 founded [The Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(New_York_City)), a newspaper that marks the beginnings of what came to be known as *penny press*. Being sold, of course, by one penny, it made the news more available to lower-income readers, at a time when most papers cost five cents to buy. Day understood that newspapers buyers were the product, and his was the first attempt at, instead of selling the news to the readers, reselling the attention his newspaper draw to advertisers. He was the first of [The Attention Merchants](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0804170045/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0804170045&linkCode=as2&tag=alvaroduran-20&linkId=0fe96d8663398b8c833e5a73ad536c99). A breed of their own, almost all sons of priests that understood the power of well versed words to command and control.

A consequence of that innovative business model is the total dependence on holding attention. Under the competition of similar newspapers, the race naturally ran to the bottom, to the grotesque and mind-blowing and enraging and vivid. Whatever engages what cognitive scientists now call "automatic" attention.

Such a race can only collapse and outburst public contempt when it's taken too far.

The race for our attention has been run in two dimensions. One is circular; new forms of entertainment attract by their novelty the attention of the wide population, like Season 1 of your favourite series. It's fantastic, and new, and high quality, and draws your attention to it with charm. The novelty will nevertheless fade away, and newer formulas would be tried to hold your attention, each one more absurd than the others, until the final collapse and backlash. You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain. Eventually, a new form of attention arises, and the circle starts again.

The second one is linear: it's the rise the tides, where society has progressively given up more and more of its personal space in favour of sponsored entertainment. A *troubadour* could only grasp the attention of so many people in the village he was touring. But a newspaper could be circulated more easily, and spread as fast as the fastest vehicle. We could then carry it with us anywhere, but still have the ability to ignore it. Radio, TV and computers put an end to that: our house was now a place where ads could be run, but they weren't something portable, and thus our commutes were save from publicity, up to a point. Eventually, smartphones had turned us into zombies, walking the street facing down, receptive to any stimulus coming from that tiny, luminous screen.

With that, also comes the intensity. Billboards do not have the same power that Amazon data-driven recommendations do, because they sit at different levels of what's called the *purchase funnel*, or the steps consumers go through before making a purchase; billboards aim at making people aware of the product or the need for that product; Amazon places recommendations when the need has just been identified, making it much more effectively. The Holy Grail of advertising, one that people are eager to see, was eventually found.

Advertising never dies. It doesn't matter how many times it gets killed; it eventually revives, like the phoenix, transformed and ready for another take. It's biological; [we are restless when we are bored](/being-bored), and we must always __pay attention to something__. The door for the advertiser is, thus, always open.

It never dies because in the same way we pay attention, we want others to pay attention to us. It's the hierarchical structure of our societies, predating even the first humans. We have evolved to climb the ladder, to become the peak of the pyramids and the role model of our peers. In biology, advertisers have found the secret for their immortality.

Our attention is designed to face inwards. It's easy to be self-conscious, and hard to empathise. In the constant battle for our attention, networking tools like Google and Facebook culminate a process that started with dumping undifferentiated messages into the wild and approached the consumers slowly but inexorably. In marketing textbooks, you define a *persona*, a stereotype you aim at selling something to. Technology has provided us with the tools to now turn the *persona* into *each person*.
