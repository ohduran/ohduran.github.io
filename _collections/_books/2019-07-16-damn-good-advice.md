Scale is a beautiful, modern thing. For the most part of human time on Earth, we have communicate with each other face to face. From utterances to words to gossip, we conveyed and still convey knowledge by speaking to someone next to us. Only recently, we have develop the tools that allow for communication at scale. And we are still getting used to it.

If you recall our discussion in [How to Read a Book](/how-to-read-a-book), communication happens when we come to terms with the author. That is, when we process, ruminate and think over the words being conveyed, when we ask questions and get answers, when reciprocity happens and we eventually tap into what the writer means. If we are lucky, we are allowed as much time as we want to understand the issue at hand, and the proposed solution by the author.

But we aren’t always that lucky.

When I go out, I feel like there’s a war going on. A barrage of posters, bans and window displays fire at my senses, aiming at my attention. If I tune out and grab my headphones, I may listen to the company sponsoring the podcast I’m listening. Looking into my smartphone is no different; free content, brought to you by XYZ Inc. We live in a world mediated by media. Everywhere I go, I’m in no-man’s land for the attention wars. Run for cover.

All these ads struggle with the same meta-problem: the discovery problem. The fact that I’m not even aware of either the problem at hand, nor the solution the company found for it. The fact that I’m in no mood to be sold something, because my attention span when I’m doing something else is limited, and I want either to be left alone or to be left with a complete idea of what they want.

I want to know lightning-fast, or I don’t want them.

> 4 __My Anti-slogan: “George, Be Careful!”__ […] In the art of creativity, being careful guarantees sameness and mediocrity, which means your work will be invisible. Better to be reckless than careful. Better to be bold than safe. Better to have your work seen and remembered, or you’ve struck out. There is no middle ground.

Advertising is built around the idea that there is no room for mediocrity. That if your music sounds even slightly similar to the background noise, you’re as good as silence. George Lois’s [Damn Good Advice](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0714863483/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0714863483&linkCode=as2&tag=alvaroduran-20&linkId=76bb26e62b6240189585b6050687322f) is a book about just that: how to make sure that you’re heard.

> 7 __Creating ideas without a work ethic to follow through is inconceivable to me__

In order to avoid mediocrity, there is no royal road; you must sweat your way to the top. In order of importance, Lois summarised his life and work in 120 slogans, because advertising shouldn’t be about conveying long essays, but straight to the point, mind-blowing statements. Political correctness is for crowds, but Big Ideas must be echoed by the masses, or they are worthless. This is George Lois’s element.

> 9 __All creativity should communicate in a nanosecond__


This, however, isn’t easy. Lois recalls that quote from Lincoln: “I’m sorry I could not have written a shorter letter, but I didn’t have the time”. Keeping things short mean having to think longer about the words you use. For that matter, creativity doesn’t come as a striking moment; you have to put the work, and the more the merrier.

> 14 __A trend is always a trap__

Because he thinks of advertising as an art, you can’t approach a new problem with the same set of tools that you used to solve the previous one; every new painting must start with a “blank canvas”. Trends are just something safe, something that leads to oblivion. Relying on clickbaits, I figure, is not just bad business; it makes you invisible.

> 18 __There’s a great solution, a Big Idea, buried in every assignment__

Instead, go for the Big Idea, a simple statement that put together instantly the message and the connotations desired to be broadcasted. Only assuming there’s always one, you’ll go into the problem heads on, unwilling to settle for anything but.

> 21 __”Advertising”, I replied, “is Poison Gas!”__

“It should bring tears to your eyes, unhinge your nervous system, and knock you out”. Ancient philosophers may have been able to describe the creative process, but they never applied it to their own work, and thus they belong to a literary classroom, and not to widespread knowledge.

But what if you fail? What if what you think is a Big Idea is simply…not? You must test whether you’ve gone far enough; if not, push it a little bit.

> 24 __Drive your Big Idea to the very edge of the cliff (but if you go too far, it’s a fiery death)__

The real challenge is not being a provocateur; it’s knowing when to stop. A lot of people “chicken out”, not daring to become salient in a world filled with ordinary people. In any case, you must take the risk. There is no such thing as a “Cautious Creative”.

> 27 __Teamwork *might* work in building an Amish barn, but it can’t create a Big Idea__

In a world where open floor offices are pervasive, Lois is a contrarian. He just doesn’t believe in teamwork to communicate ideas. In the end, any creative process can be traced back to just one person. No wonder [several of Lois's former associates claimed he took credit for ad campaigns, ad copy and *Esquire* covers that were partially or wholly the work of others](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/383/transcript).

> 33 __Make your presence felt__

On this section of the book, Lois deals with his beginnings: must have a shocking portfolio, must work your ass off, must be thankful for doing something that you love and getting paid for it. Sounds like an excuse for seniors to justify low paying internships, but the fact is, you won’t stand out trying to fit in.

> 36 __Most people work at *keeping* their job, rather than *doing* a good job__

In order to go to the next level, you must separated from the rest, do something risky, and avoid trends. The best piece of advice that could be given to first year undergraduates is “don’t study Economics”. Throughout my senior year in high school, I was constantly repeated that majoring in  Business was economically sensible, because there was so many jobs out there for you.

For me, it was obvious that it would eventually become the opposite. Now, my generation is full of people with Business degrees that are, in the face of so many others holding it too, worthless.


> 38 __The ultimate act of Scholarship and Theater is the art of selling__

If you’re an expert, show some [Skin in the Game](/skin-in-the-game) and put your reputation on the line. Otherwise, you’re just a charlatan. The most thrilling story of this involves [Duveen](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1907970576/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1907970576&linkCode=as2&tag=alvaroduran-20&linkId=9a5065b964419b081adf6e632b59661e) and J.P. Morgan:

> [J.P. Morgan] had heard that the elder Duveen was an expert in Chinese ceramics, so he invited the Duveens for a visit. When Joseph Joel, Uncle Henry and the young Joseph Duveen arrived, J. P. Morgan showed them five Chinese ceramic beakers. He explained that three were priceless, and that two were fakes. "Tell me which ones are the fakes.”
>
> The elder Duveen studied the five ceramics, then raised his cane and with great force, smashed two of them! He explained that if he were mistaken, he'd of course reimburse Morgan for the loss. Duveen had been correct, and the astonished J. P. Morgan was both relieved and impressed.

> [J. P. Morgan Meets the Duveens](https://allthingsruffnerian.blogspot.com/2011/04/j-p-morgan-meets-duveens.html), All Things Ruffnerian

It is selling what will bring you on your client’s good graces. You are hired to sell something on behalf of your clients; but the meta game is selling them yourself as an expert. And the only language everyone speaks for that is having skin in the game.

> 46 __If all else fails, threaten to commit suicide__

There is, nevertheless, another level of abstraction. Like the 21 year old kid who turns down a Google job offer to work on his startup, your reputation is worth the clients you say no to.

> 54 __Never eat shit__

Where do you get your ideas from? Museums like MoMA, newspapers like The New York Times… get yourself so familiar with high quality that there is no room in your thoughts for mediocrity. But at the same time, a thinking person must approach reports and other sources of information with skepticism.

In the end, you want your ideas to be [Antifragile](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812979680/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0812979680&linkCode=as2&tag=alvaroduran-20&linkId=6fc644194b9da371eefe70a2ec9c2a23); you must *crave immortality*.

> 81 __If you’re going to criticize something, don’t hold back__

Speak up, speak up, speak up. That will make you stand out. We may be afraid of the consequences of having a big mouth, but in reality, people respect those who have the character to speak truth to power, because they have skin in the game, and they are reliable.

> 90 __A creative person without a sense of humor has a serious problem__

In any creative process, humour stands apart as a way to reberberate thoughts on someone else’s brain by means of a relaxing atmosphere. If a gag is funny, you’ll spread it out. We humans are wired to share what makes us happy. Humour turns, hence, into a propagandistic tool that must be used over and over in advertising.

The fact that humour is difficult makes it all the more worth it. Wit wakes up the mind.

> 104 __Learn to write one singular, coherent, informative, insightful, spectacular sentence to replace your illiterate, off-the-cuff twittering!__

Or better yet: quit social media, like we suggested in [Deep Work](/deep-work). This will allow you to make things perfect the first time. Because you can.

> 108 __Then why the fuck didn’t you make it that way in the first place!__

Working at your best is what your client deserves, but also what you deserve. Otherwise, you’ll stall, produce mediocre work, stress out, and live miserably.

> 118 __”If you do it right, it will live forever”__

In the end, you need to realise that everything is in your hands. That your future, and the future of humanity, is for you to shape at your will. The impact you can make is now global; the era of widespread communication allows for it. Be a creator, and keep up the good work!
