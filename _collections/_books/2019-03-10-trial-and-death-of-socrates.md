This is the end game. We have discussed language several times now: [How to Read a Book](/how-to-read-a-book) showed us how conversations can happen at different levels because we haven't agreed what words mean before our conversation started; we discussed the implications of human language in Wittgenstein's [Tractatus](/tractatus-logico-philosophicus), and how what is real and tangible can be described, but what is metaphysical is groundless and must be avoided. We covered the interaction between how we think and how we speak in [Through the Language Glass](/through-the-language-glass) and [Politics and the English Language](/politics-and-the-english-language), and found some time to cover Chomsky's main thesis in [The Architecture of Language](/the-architecture-of-language).

It's time we grow in ourselves some [skin in the game](/skin-in-the-game): how would a wise man talk his way out of a trial for his life?

You wouldn't be able to test that in court nowadays. Advanced civilisation has come up with a set of rituals that aim at making truth reveal itself on witness testimonies and cross examinations and overruled and sustained objections. There is no room left for an eager amateur to find an unconventional route: since the Roman Republic, all the paths have been explored. Like [Shakelton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Shackleton), we live in a world that has already moved on from exploratory expeditions.

If we are to find guidelines on laymen talking their way out of capital sentence, we need to go back to when democracy was in its infancy: the trial of Socrates is our perfect *petri dish*.

Democracy wasn't born out of the blue. Before the first attempt at democratic government, Athens was ruled by the local aristocracy, the archons, but the feuding among them have had brought an unbearable burden to the rest of the Athenians. In the 6th century BC, Solon, premier archon at the time, liberated the Athenian labouring class and halt the feuding.

> Some wicked men are rich, some good are poor;
>
> We will not change our virtue for their store:
>
> Virtue's a thing that none can take away,
>
> But money changes owners all the day.
>
> -- __Solon__


Solon issued reforms to define citizenship in a way that gave a greater amount of people the right to participate in assembly meetings. Thus, the ability to articulate opinions in a convincing manner turned overnight into a powerful skill. The increasingly wealthy city of Athens, who led what came to be known as the [Delian League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delian_League), attracted a class of intellectuals who taught courses in various subjects, speculated about the nature of language and culture and employed rhetoric to achieve their purposes: the sophists. Protagoras, Gorgias, Prodicus... a set of professionals of the eloquence came to Athens and shaped the infant democracy, and focused the debate on the topic of truth and morality.

Can a guilty person exercise his rhetorical skills to be found non guilty in court? Are the laws ensuring a harmonious society?

These sophists claimed that they could find the answers to all questions, and convince anyone of anything. Many sophists taught their skills for a price, and due to the importance of such skills in the litigious social life of Athens, practitioners often commanded very high fees. And although the word 'sophist' has nowadays a connotation of deceit, this connotation comes from the hostile attitude that Plato had towards them. A relative of Solon, Plato had witnessed how his ancestor's good intentions had been perverted by this class of professionals of the eloquence. He joined the ranks of a competitive group, who, against the pretentious of the sophists, who 'knew all', seek humbly to know more, because they 'knew nothing'. These were the philosophers, and Socrates was the first of his kind. For the general population though, they were two sides of the same coin.

The fact that the sophists questioned the existence and roles of traditional deities, and proposed alternative explanations for natural phenomena prompted a popular reaction against them. The *zeitgeist* of this reaction can be found in [The Clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clouds). In 'The Clouds', Socrates is a character depicted as a petty thief, at worst, and a foolish man to take pity on, at worst.

> PUPIL: But the other day he [Socrates] lost a great idea because of a lizard.
>
> STREPSIADES: Really? Please tell me how.
>
> PUPIL: He was studying the tracks of the lunar orbit / and its revolutions, and as he skyward gaped, / from the roof in darkness a lizard shat on him.
>
> -- __Aristophanes__, The Clouds

While all of this was happening, the city of Athens as a whole and its imperialistic behaviour towards other members of the Delian League led to tensions. Eventually, the Peloponnesian War broke out after clashing against Sparta. Athens was humiliated, and the commander of the army, Alcibiades, took most of the blame. With it, public animosity was fuelled towards any of Alcibiades' associates, like Socrates.

He was in the midst of public defamation, the backlash at arrogant sophists, and blamed for a traumatic war defeat. It's the decay of Greek democracy, and those who represent it are going to be punished for it.

## Euthyphro

> EUTHYPHRO: Why have you left the Lyceum, Socrates? and what are you doing in the porch of the King Archon? Surely you can not be engaged in an action before the king, as I am.
>
> SOCRATES: Not in an action, Euthyphro; impeachment is the word which the Athenians use.
>
> -- __Trial and Death of Socrates__

This is where our story begins. In the first of the four dialogues, Socrates bumps into Euthyphro, near the court of the *archon basileus* (king magistrate); each man is present at the court for the preliminary hearings to possible trials. It's where we are presented what is Socrates accused of.

> SOCRATES: [My accuser] says he knows how the youth are corrupted and who are their corruptors. I fancy that he must be a wise man, and seeing that I am anything but a wise man, he has found me out, and is going to accuse me of corrupting his young friends.
>
> [...] He says that I am a poet or maker of gods, and that I make new gods and deny the existence of old ones; this is the ground of his indictment.
>
> -- __Trial and Death of Socrates__

Sophists are eloquent, and perhaps took their eloquence too far. Denying the existence of gods wasn't just heresy, it was illegal, and people who questioned everything and everyone were tying their fate to the democratic right to question everything. It was a matter of time before the spearhead of rhetoric, the inventor of the socratic dialogue, was made scapegoat of the humiliation of Athens.

And socratic dialogue is what we have in this first section: Socrates is a master of it, and he challenges Euthyphro to define what is piety, stretching the extent of his underlying assumptions up to a point where he eventually gives up. Socrates is a wise man, but under the eloquence and the depth of his reasoning you can find the irony, the arrogance, the vanity. Like in many other works by Plato, Socrates does all the conversation heavy lifting; Euthyphro is left with just agreeing here and there to everything he says. It's just too easy.

He is overwhelmingly smart. He can triumph over any argument, because he clinch onto the idea that no one knows anything for sure. But in doing so, he forgets about basic human nature: people get pissed off.

> SOCRATES: Then we must begin again and ask, What is piety?
>
> EUTHYPHRO: Another time, Socrates; for I am in a hurry, and must go now.
>
> -- __Trial and Death of Socrates__

If this is the opening of anything, the terms are clear: he's going to win the argument, but he isn't going to win the jury. The fact that it all boils down to a jury of 500 men, as it was the norm, is going to work against him.

## Apology

> How you have felt, Oh men of Athens, at hearing the speeches of my accusers, I cannot tell; but I know that their persuasive words almost made me forget who I was: — such was the effect of them; and yet they have hardly spoken a word of truth.
>
> -- __Trial and Death of Socrates__

This second section, called the Apology, is one of many explanatory *apologia* about Socrates's legal defence. Although Aristotle later classified it as a genre of fiction, it is still a useful historical source about Socrates: not only it's Socrates the one talking, Plato is witnessing the speech unfold.

### First part: The defence

It was custom that the accused had three hours to refute the accusations, and this first part covers precisely that.

What would your strategy be? The problem with the claims that he corrupts the youth and that he creates false gods is that they are hard to refute. What is 'corrupt'? Is expressing an opinion corrupting the mind of young people? Is researching nature a form of god creation?

The accusers, Socrates imply, have told the jury before he starts to speak, "not to let yourselves be deceived by the force of [Socrate's] eloquence". They expect the rhetoric, the convoluted reasoning, and they tagged the only weapon that Socrates has to save himself to the bad reputation of sophists, so he must address that first.

> SOCRATES: I do indeed admit that I am eloquent. But in how different a way from theirs! [...] but you shall hear from me the whole truth: not, however, delivered after their manner, in a set oration duly ornamented with words and phrases. No, indeed! but I shall use the words and arguments which occur to me at the moment; for I am certain that this is right, and that at my time of life I ought not to be appearing before you, O men of Athens, in the character of a juvenile orator.
>
> -- __Trial and Death of Socrates__

How to turn the 'corrupting the youth' accusation upside down? By addressing the fact that their prejudice is also a form of corruption, and if he is accused of that, then every man and woman is guilty of that. That's maybe an argument that is legally useless nowadays (it's admission of guilt), but remember that the strict rules that govern our judicial system do not apply here.

> SOCRATES: First, I have to reply to the older charges and to my first accusers, and then I will go on to the later ones. For I have had many accusers, who accused me of old, and their false charges have continued during many years.
>
> -- __Trial and Death of Socrates__

Socrates, thus, begins by telling the jury that their minds were already poisoned to begin with, when they were young and impressionable.

> SOCRATES: But far more dangerous are these, who began when you were children, and took possession of your minds with their falsehoods, telling of one Socrates, a wise man, who speculated about the heaven above, and searched into the earth beneath, and made the worse appear the better cause [...].
>
> These are the accusers whom I dread; for they are the circulators of this rumour, and their hearers are too apt to fancy that speculators of this sort do not believe in the gods. And they are many, and their charges against me are of ancient date, and they made them in days when you were impressible— in childhood, or perhaps in youth— and the cause when heard went by default, for there was none to answer.
>
> And hardest of all, their names I do not know and can not tell; unless in the chance case of a comic poet. [...] I must simply fight with shadows in my own defence, and examine when there is no one who answers.
>
> -- __Trial and Death of Socrates__

Where did all of this begin? There were probably many causes; Socrates is focused on the most visible: Aristophanes.

> SOCRATES: “Socrates is an evil-doer, and a curious person, who searches into things under the earth and in heaven, and he makes the worse appear the better cause; and he teaches the aforesaid doctrines to others.” That is the nature of the accusation, and that is what you have seen yourselves in the comedy of Aristophanes, who has introduced a man whom he calls Socrates, going about and saying that he can walk in the air, and talking a deal of nonsense.
>
> -- __Trial and Death of Socrates__

Rumours and propaganda. They're timeless. Socrates refers to his life motto: he can't corrupt anyone, because he knows nothing about anything.

The fact that he has a reputation for being the wisest man comes, he says, from another rumour. One that concerns a prophecy by the oracle of Delphi.

> SOCRATES: You must have known Chaerephon [...]. He went to Delphi and boldly asked the oracle to tell him [...] whether there was any one wiser than I was, and the Pythian prophetess answered, that there was no man wiser.
>
> -- __Trial and Death of Socrates__

Now that is believed to come directly from Apollo: that there is no man wiser than Socrates. Everyone took it to be proof that Socrates knew lots of things. Socrates, of course, asked himself "what does Apollo mean by that?". And instead of taking it to be true, like everyone else did, he tried to prove it wrong.

> SOCRATES: I reflected that if I could only find a man wiser than myself, then I might go to the god with a refutation in my hand.
>
> -- __Trial and Death of Socrates__

He thus talked to anyone who was deemed to be wise, a famous politician, but the conversation eventually might have turned into a socratic dialog like the one held with Euthyphro, with similar end.

>SOCRATES: When I began to talk with him, I could not help thinking that he was not really wise, although he was thought wise by many, and wiser still by himself; and I went and tried to explain to him that he thought himself wise , but was not really wise; and the consequence was that he hated me, and his enmity was shared by several who were present and heard me.
>
> -- __Trial and Death of Socrates__

We have to assume that some of those people eventually made up the jury, or at least part of it. That is, there is a second degree of prejudice that Socrates is up against: he'd pissed off a lot of influential people.

How had he resolved Apollo's riddle? He concluded that he is as wise as any, because he knows nothing; but he is superior in the fact that he at least has acknowledge his ignorance.

> SOCRATES: The truth is, O men of Athens, that God only is wise; and in this oracle he means to say that the wisdom of men is little or nothing; he is not speaking of Socrates, he is only using my name as an illustration, as if he said, He, O men, is the wisest who, like Socrates, knows that his wisdom is in truth worth nothing.
>
> -- __Trial and Death of Socrates__

This approach to life is what he had taught "young men of the richer classes, who have not much to do". That's how he spend his days, that's what is so corrupt about what he preaches: he is questioning the status quo.

> SOCRATES: Those who are examined by [these young men], instead of being angry with themselves are angry with me: This confounded Socrates, they say; this villainous misleader of youth!— and then if somebody asks them, Why, what evil does he practise or teach? they do not know, and can not tell
>
> But in order that they may not appear to be at a loss, they repeat the ready-made charges which are used against all philosophers about teaching things up in the clouds and under the earth, and having no gods, and making the worse appear the better cause.
>
> For they do not like to confess that their pretence of knowledge has been detected— which is the truth; and as they are numerous and ambitious and energetic, and are all in battle array and have persuasive tongues, they have filled your ears with their loud and inveterate calumnies.
>
> -- __Trial and Death of Socrates__

That ends the defence against the corruption of the youth. So far, he's been defensive about how to approach the accusations against him. For the accusation of believing in false gods, he turns on the offensive.

> SOCRATES: [Meletus, the accuser] says that I am a doer of evil, who corrupt the youth; but I say, O men of Athens, that Meletus is a doer of evil, and the evil is that he makes a joke of a serious matter, and is too ready at bringing other men to trial from a pretended zeal and interest about matters in which he really never had the smallest interest.
>
> And the truth of this I will endeavour to prove.
>
> -- __Trial and Death of Socrates__

He then embarks himself and Meletus into a Socratic dialogue, which aims at proving that no one would corrupt anyone voluntarily, because the corrupter stands to be eventually harmed in vengeance; and that if anyone is corrupted, then it's obvious that it is the jury, by means of the works of Aristophanes. The fact that he relies so much on the conditions of 'The Clouds' being a propagandistic work troubles me as an innocent bystander: why would Aristophanes want to portrait Socrates as such? What's in it for him?

Afterwards, Socrates addresses the accusation of impiety, leading Meletus into contradicting himself, because he is accusing Socrates of both being an atheist and believing in false gods.

> SOCRATES: Such nonsense, Meletus, could only have been intended by you as a trial of me. You have put this into the indictment because you had nothing real of which to accuse me. But no one who has a particle of understanding will ever be convinced by you that the same men can believe in divine and superhuman things, and yet not believe that there are gods and demigods and heroes.
>
> -- __Trial and Death of Socrates__

He then addresses the jury, finally, with the latests remarks: that he had done nothing wrong, and that the jury stands to kill their souls if they find him guilty.

> SOCRATES: I have said enough in answer to the charge of Meletus: any elaborate defence is unnecessary; but as I was saying before, I certainly have many enemies, and this is what will be my destruction if I am destroyed; of that I am certain;—not Meletus, nor yet Anytus, but the envy and detraction of the world, which has been the death of many good men, and will probably be the death of many more; there is no danger of my being the last of them.
>
> -- __Trial and Death of Socrates__

Like Achilles, they should be thinking not in terms of harming the body, but in fearing the consequences for their immortal souls. Finding Socrates deserving of capital punishment may harm Socrates body, but it will surely harm their souls as well.

> SOCRATES: I am not going to argue for my own sake, as you may think, but for yours, that you may not sin against the God, or lightly reject his boon by condemning me. For if you kill me you will not easily find another like me, who, if I may use such a ludicrous figure of speech, am a sort of gadfly, given to the state by the God; and. the state is like a great and noble steed who is tardy in his motions owing to his very size, and requires to be stirred into life.
>
> -- __Trial and Death of Socrates__

## Second part: Sentencing plea

The jurors of the trial voted the guilt of Socrates by a narrow margin: "had thirty votes gone over to the other side, I should have been acquitted". In those cases where the death penalty may arise, a sentencing plea was required so that the prosecutor and the defendant each propose a penalty to punish the actions for which the accused has been found guilty.

At this point, Socrates is emotional. He's been found guilty for something that he believes are lies, and so he antagonises the jury. Rather than a penalty, he proposes a reward:

> SOCRATES: And so [Meletus] proposes death as the penalty. And what shall I propose on my part, O men of Athens? Clearly that which is my due. And what is that which I ought to pay or to receive ? What shall be done to the man who has never had the wit to be idle during his whole life? [...]
>
> There can be no more fitting reward than maintenance in the Prytaneum, O men of Athens, a reward which he deserves far more than the citizen who has won the prize at Olympia in the horse or chariot race, whether the chariots were drawn by two horses or by many. For I am in want, and he has enough; and he only gives you the appearance of happiness, and I give you the reality.
>
> -- __Trial and Death of Socrates__

As punishment, he dares to propose that he be treated like the benefactors of the city; that he should be given free meals, in perpetuity, at the Prytaneum, the public dining hall of Athens, an honour reserved for, among others, Olympic athletes.

The provocative language and tone of Socrates's self-defence speech angered the jurors: he was sentenced to death.
