>If language is to serve as an effective means of communication, then the private systems of knowledge in speakers’ mind must closely correspond with the public system of linguistic conventions. And it is because of this correspondence that the public conventions of language can mirror what goes in the most fascinating and most elusive object in the entire universe, our mind.

My father is a dentist. Like anyone in his profession, he talks to a lot of people face to face, and has to deal with a very confusing space perception on a daily basis. That is, when he asks a patient to move her jaw to the left, he expects the jaw to move to his right, and vice-versa. Of course, this isn’t confusing anymore for him, given the amount of practice. He has developed a sense of directions that is completely backwards, because he needs it. His patient and him are communicating correctly to one another, because he has accommodated his sense of left and right accordingly.

But just imagine how difficult it is to give directions to him while he’s driving.

Any species on Earth that thrives on the interactions of several of its members, like bees or bears, whales or wolves, has some way to communicate knowledge among themselves.

Communication happens because someone conveys an encoded message through a channel that is decoded by someone else. But, as we have discussed in [How to Read a Book](/how-to-read-a-book) and in the [Tractatus](/tractatus-logico-philosophicus), this encoding and decoding, what we call ‘language’, is problematic. Language is needed to communicate, but it’s also an obstacle.

It’s an obstacle because the rules that govern our language have been ‘fine tuned’ by thousands of years of speakers, their conventions and quirks, their thoughts and lives. What has come to us is the result of a process that started with the chimpanzees and is still happening today. It’s the same process that affects our society, and our culture. My father is the perfect example of this: what we call ‘left’ and ‘right’ are just conventions that ease communication between both parties. But the same words do not mean the same in different contexts.

Moreover, there is a historical component in the words we use. Take for instance the word “*moustache*”. It’s ‘*mustacchi*’ in Italian, ‘*moustache*’ in French, ‘*mustasch*’ in Swedish. It’s derived from the Medieval Latin ‘*moustaccium*’, which like many Latin words, derived from Ancient Greek, ‘μουστάκιον’, ‘*moustakion*’. Pretty much every language that had come from Latin has a variation of the same word.

Then why on Earth, in Spanish, we use ‘*bigote*’? Because of the Germans: during the kingship of Charles I, both Spanish and German armies had to fight shoulder to shoulder, and German’s constant shouting, ‘*bei Gott!*’, was a source of amusement to the Spanish troops. Eventually, the German came to be known as ‘bigotes’, and their most characteristic feature, their moustaches, claimed the meaning of the word itself.

This little story is one of many that ground the conviction that a nation’s language reflects its culture, psyche, and modes of thought. It’s the result of the evolutionary forces that shape it, but also of the usage. Like a knife that is sharpen with a whetstone, so is language sharpen with its usage to become more useful.

But vignettes abound: people in tropical climes are so laid-back and thus let most of their consonant fall by the wayside; German is a particular orderly language for a particular kind of orderly minds; French is Romance, and English is promiscuous and adaptable.

How much truth are in those stereotypes? Is the fact that the English ‘billionaire’ and the Spanish ‘*billonario*’ [do not refer to the same amount](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/explore/how-many-is-a-billion) of wealth a consequence of the wealth being seen differently in Anglo-Saxon countries and Spain and South America?

> We infer the spirit of the nation in great measure from the language, which is a sort of monument to which each forcible individual in a course of many hundred years has contributed a stone.
>
> -- __Ralph W Emerson__

The only problem is that this breaks down as soon as thinkers move beyond the general principles to reflect on the particular qualities of languages. For Bertrand Russell, the lack of a word in English that translates French’s ‘spirituel’ means a lacking spirituality on the Englishmen; for Cicero, the absence of a word for ‘tactless’ in Greek, ‘*ineptus*’ in Latin, was proof that the fault was so spread among the Greeks that they didn’t even notice it.

Then comes the biases. What could possibly be the most ‘natural’ language for a French?

> We French follow in all our utterances exactly the order of thought, which is the order of Nature.
>
> -- __Louis Le Laboreur__

In their claims, even big thinkers are no different from the little ones. Does language reflect the culture of a society in any sense beyond the number of words that eskimos have for snow?

The answer is nowadays considered to be no, with [Noam Chomsky](/the-architecture-of-language) as the leading proponent. Even if some may concede some influence, any such influence is negligible.

The book we are talking about today is [Through the Language Glass](https://archive.org/details/ThroughTheLanguageGlass/page/n8), and it’s about finding how much truth are in this answer. First, the way our languages carve up the world into concepts is not entirely ‘nature’, but also has a component of ‘nurture’. And second, the linguistic conventions of our society can affect aspects of our thought that go beyond language.

## Part 1 - The Language Mirror

What do you do when you have been Chancellor of the Exchequer but have time to kill while on the opposition benches for five years? For William Gladstone, the answer is writing a book. Unlike our contemporary politicians, he is much more interested in writing not about himself, but about Homer’s epics, The Iliad and the Odyssey.

> I think more and more about how all of Western culture is a footnote to Iliad, Book 9.
>
> -- __Matt Levine__

There is something awry about Homer, the author of the Iliad and the Odyssey, with regards to how he perceives and uses colour. In the [last volume of his Studies on Homer and the Homeric Age](https://www.amazon.com/Studies-Homer-Homeric-Age-V3/dp/149812478X?SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&tag=duckduckgo-ffab-es-21&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=149812478X), Gladstone analysis led him to believe that Homer and his contemporaries perceived the world in something closer to black and white than in ‘full Technicolor’.

> How could such a basic aspect of human experience have changed? [...] If there is one phrase that represents a rock of stability in the flux of human experience, then surely it would be that timeless question ‘Daddy, why is the sky blue?’
>
> -- __Through the Language Glass__

Although the Homeric epics contain what appear to be colour words (some of which became straightforward colour words in later Greek), Gladstone noted that
these occurred surprisingly infrequently; and, more remarkably, that some of the apparent colour words which do occur are attributed to ranges of things which no present­ day European would see as sharing a common colour.

For instance, the adjective *porphyreos*, which in later Greek meant approximately “purple” or “dark red”, is applied to blood, a dark cloud, the wave of a river when disturbed, a wave of the sea, the disturbed sea, and the rainbow. The same verb is applied to the sea darkening, and to the mind brooding, and, as a compound adjective, to wool.

> Probably the single most famous phrase from [Homer’s work] that is still in common currency today is [...] ‘wine-dark sea’. [...] What Homer actually says is ‘oinops’, which literally means ‘wine-looking’.
>
> -- __Through the Language Glass__

Not everyone at the time read Gladstone this way. William Pole, who was colour ­blind himself, [believed](https://ia800703.us.archive.org/33/items/paper-doi-10_1038_018676a0/paper-doi-10_1038_018676a0.pdf) that Gladstone failed to appreciate that his data on Homer’s colour vocabulary suggested colour ­blindness. But Pole couldn’t explain the predominance of black (170 times) in contrast to red (13), yellow (10) or violet (6) in Homer’s work, nor he could explain the absence of blue across the Iliad and the Odyssey.

Gladstone dared to suggest an explanation for this, an outrageous one, or so he thought.

> As he put it, ‘the organs of colour and its impressions were but partially developed among the Greeks of the heroic age’. […] The undeveloped state of colour perception, Gladstone argues, can immediately explain why Homer had such lively and poetic conceptions of light and darkness while being so tight-lipped on prismatic colours.
>
> -— __Through the Language Glass__

We have educated our eyes! But why did it take so long? By Homeric times, we have had been humans for thousands of years, if not millions. Some would argue that the process should have been more smooth, instead of virtually no progress during the first 99% of our existence as species, and a sudden leap out of nowhere around that time.

To Gladstone, colour became a separate entity from the object that is coloured only when people developed the technology to paint and dye, to artificially apply colours to objects. That capacity barely existed in Homer’s day.

> The eye may require a familiarity with an ordered system of colours, as the condition of its being able closely to appreciate anyone among them.
>
> -- __William Gladstone__

The idea that people can evolve into seeing colour better sounded weird at the time. It all changed on 22 November 1859, when The Origin of Species was published, and Darwinism conquered the collective psyche: the stock of 1,250 copies for the first edition was oversubscribed, which forced its author to come back from a hydropathic establishment at Ilkley in Yorkshire where he went to recuperate from the strain of publishing, and begin corrections for a second edition.

> Overflowing the narrow bounds of purely scientific circles, the "species question" divides with [Italy and the Volunteers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_unification) the attention of general society. Everybody has read Mr. Darwin's book, or, at least, has given an opinion upon its merits or demerits.
>
> -- __[Thomas Huxley](http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=A32&viewtype=text&pageseq=1)__

Against this backdrop, the 1867 Assembly of German Naturalists and Physicians hold a plenary lecture called ‘On the Colour Sense in Primitive Times and its Evolution’, by Lazarus Geiger. His linguistic investigations convinced him that he could trace in language evidence of evolution, in the same way that Ernst Haeckel had done in palaeontology.

> Has human sensation, has perception  by the senses, a history? Did everything in the human sense organs thousands of years ago function exactly as it does now, or can we perhaps show that at some remote period these organs must have been partly incapable of their presence performance?
>
> -- __Lazarus Geiger__, ‘On the Colour Sense in Primitive Times and Its Evolution’, 1867

While most contemporaries wrote off Gladstone’s claims, Geiger was inspired by them, and extrapolate Gladstone’s work on his realm of knowledge: ancient texts. Like Homeric Greek, biblical Hebrew does not have a word for ‘blue’, and it’s full of colour inconsistencies: gold is green.

> Though ye have lain among the sheepfolds, [ye shall be as] wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with green gold.
>
> -- __Pslams 68:13__, Darby’s Translation

Widening Gladstone’s circle of evidence, Geiger saw similar traits in Indian Vedic poems, Icelandic sagas and even the Koran. On the basis of this, he thus reconstructs a complete chronological sequence: mankind perception of colour increased ‘according to the schema of the colour spectrum’: red, yellow, green, and only finally to blue and violet, in exactly the same order in different cultures all over the world.

Geiger was the first to explicitly pose the fundamental question.

> What could be the physiological state of a human generation which could describe the colour of the sky only as black? Can the difference between them and us be only in the naming, or in the perception itself?
>
> -- __Lazarus Geiger__, ‘On the Colour Sense in Primitive Times and Its Evolution’, 1867

Geiger would die three years later, and the question remained a challenge for a decade, until 1875, when two Swedish trains collided on the single-track line between Malmö and Stockholm, due to the northbound train driver ignoring supposedly a red light at the small station that would have allowed the southbound train pass. And I said supposedly because a tenacious professor called Frithiof Holmgren tested the 266 railway workers and found 13 cases of colour blindness, among them a stationmaster and a driver.

The practical dangers in an age of expanding railway networks around the world brought colour vision into the spotlight. The climate was most favourable for a treatise, written by Hugo Magnus in 1877, called On the Historical Evolution of the Colour Sense, which laid out an anatomical model that could explain Geiger’s thesis.

> The retina’s performance was gradually increased by the continuously and incessantly penetrating rays of light. The stimulus produced by the unremitting pounding of the ether particles continually refined the responsiveness of the sensitive elements of the retina, until they stirred the first signs of colour perception.
>
> -- __Hugo Magnus__, ‘On the Historical Evolution of the Colour Sense’, 1877.

If you’re familiar with [Lamarckism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamarckism) and giraffes stretching their necks to the sky, that’s what this is: acquired adaptations that were inherited by next generations, further increased through practice. Today’s children learn at school that this is only a fable: physical changes undergone during a lifetime won’t be passed on to the offspring. That’s why the [Padaung women in Burma](http://factsanddetails.com/asian/cat66/sub417/entry-2761.html) are born with normal necks and Jews kids have undergone [circumcisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcision) for generations.

Today’s kids learn about Darwinism, the idea that the combination of accidental variations and natural selection was the cause of evolution. Strangely enough, Darwin himself was convinced that the result of exertions in particular organs can be passed on to the next generation. This belief was only started to be challenged after Darwin’s death, at first by a biologist called August Weissman, who cut mice tails for generations of them to prove to an incredulous scientific community that acquired characteristics or injuries cannot be inherited, unsuccessfully.

The mechanism that Gladstone had proposed in his Studies of Homer for the refinement of colour relied on the only model of evolution available at the time: Lamarckism. Magnus’s was a continuation of it, and it was problematic because of the short time span it had to assume for the development of colour vision. But if vision hadn’t changed, how could someone explain the deficiencies in language found by Gladstone and Geiger?

If vision isn’t it, then the only conclusion is that those deficiencies come from ‘imperfections’ in the language. That’s the main thesis of those who were eventually called ‘culturalists’.

> We see in essence not with two eyes but with three: with the two eyes of the body and with the eye of the mind that is behind them. And it is in this eye of the mind in which the cultural-historical progressive development of the colour sense takes place.
>
> -- __Franz Delitzsch__, 1878

The problem for the ‘culturalists’ is obvious: what kind of language is incapable of distinguish between green and blue? They argued that even nowadays language is ambiguous: you talk about ‘white wine’ even when we see that it’s greenish.

> Don’t the Italians call the yolk of an egg ‘red’ (il rosso)? Don’t we call the colour of orange juice ‘orange’ although it is in fact perfectly yellow? (Check out next time) […] Would race relations between the ‘dark browns’ and ‘pinkish brown’ have been as tortured as between ‘blacks’ and ‘whites’?
>
> -- __Through the Language Glass__

The culturalists nevertheless needed a stickier argument. So they turned to the ‘savages’. On 21 October, 1878, members of the Berlin Society of Anthropology gathered at the Berlin Zoological Garden to see a group of about thirty dark-skinned ‘Nubians’, from what is now the Sudan region. Among things like measuring sizes of noses and earlobes and shapes of genitals, the anthropologists were there to examine the Nubians’ sense of colour. Two years after Geiger’s speech, the Journal of Ethnology published a [short note](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/23028715.pdf) by Adolf Bastian, one of its co-founders, in which he argued that the oddities in the description of colours were not confined to ancient texts, since there were nations around that still marked borders between colours differently from Europeans.

> My servant in Burma once apologised that he couldn’t find a bottled I called blue (pya), because it was green (zehn). In order to punish him by making him the mockery of his fellows, I reproached him in the presence of the other servants, but quickly noticed that the object of ridicule wasn’t he but myself.
>
> __Adolf Bastian__, [“Miscellen.” Zeitschrift Für Ethnologie, vol. 1, 1869, pp. 90](www.jstor.org/stable/23028715).

Once the debate over Magnus theory flared up, the relevance of this information was clear for culturalists. Thus the exhibition at the Berlin Zoo Gardens. More intrepid scholars were extending their research to examine the sense of colour of primitive peoples in situ, like Ernst Almquist did with the Chukchis in eastern Siberia during an [ice-lock of his ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vega_Expedition#The_Expedition) while attempting to circumnavigate Eurasia.

> [Ernst Almquist] reported that the Chukchis in Siberia were quite content with using just three terms - black, white, and red- to describe any colour. Nukin, the word for black, was used also for blue and dark colours, as long as they did not contain traces of red; nidlikin was used for white and all bright colours; and tschetlju for red and anything with a trace of reddish tint.

Languages across the world were behaving exactly as predicted by Geiger and Gladstone. But the reports about the eyesight contradicted the assumption that defective vocabulary reflects defective colour vision: those ‘savages’ were able to spot the difference between colours but failed to give them different names.

Culturalists may have had the proof they needed, but they still needed a convincing alternative explanation. William Halse Rivers Rivers, the psychiatrist who would later become famous for treating [Siegfried Sassoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._H._R._Rivers#Rivers_and_Sassoon) during World War I, was invited in 1898 to join the Cambridge University anthropological expedition to the Torres Straits islands, between Australia and New Guinea, aimed at shedding light on the mental characteristics of primitive peoples.

Anthropology struggled to define what ‘culture’ really meant, and to determine the boundaries between acquire and innate aspects of human behaviour. It was essential to determine to what extent the cognitive traits of ‘savages’ differed from those of civilised people.

> For the first time trained experimental psychologists investigated by means of adequate laboratory experiment a people in a low stage of culture under their ordinary conditions of life.

> -- __Alfred Cort Haddon__, [Reports of the Cambridge Anthropological Expedition to Torres Straits](https://www.amazon.com/Reports-Cambridge-Anthropological-Expedition-Straits/dp/0521179874?SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&tag=duckduckgo-ffab-es-21&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0521179874)

River’s wanted to conduct detailed experiments on the eyesight of the natives. He had been immersed during the 1890s in the study of vision, and was keen to resolve the controversy over the colour sense. He spent four months on the remote Murray Island, with a population of about 450, sufficiently civilised to enable him to make observations and, yet, ‘sufficiently near their primitive condition to be thoroughly interesting’, as he put it.

What Rivers found fitted well with the reports: descriptions of colour were vague and indefinite; but their ability to distinguish colours was also put to a test, and a series of experiments of his own with more than 200 of them revealed that people can see the differences between all imaginable shades of colours and yet have no standard names in their language.

> Surely, there could have been only one possible conclusion for such an acutely intelligent researcher who draw from his own findings: the differences in colour vocabulary have nothing to do with biological factors.
>
> -- __Through the Language Glass__

And yet there was one experience which struck Rivers so that it managed to throw him entirely in the opposite direction: they called the sky ‘black’, and they sometimes compared the colour of the bright blue sky to that of dark dirty water. He thusly concluded that Magnus was right in assuming that the natives must still suffer from a ‘certain degree of insensitiveness to blue’.

Now, how could have got this wrong, given all the experiments that he conducted? My understanding is that he couldn’t trust his own conclusions when, clearly, common sense was pointing towards the opposite direction. No technique in the world will be able to convince you that someone sees colour in the same way that you do if they compare the bright blue sky with dark dirty water, even when younger generations, who have borrowed the word ‘blue’ from English, used it without confusion.

> One cannot, however, wholly ignore the fact that intelligent natives would regard it as perfectly natural to apply the same name to the brilliant blue of the sky and sea which they give to the deepest black.
>
> -- __W. H. R. Rivers__, 1898

Our deepest instincts yell at us that blue and black are really separate colours. But if a Russian anthropologist would have gone on a remote expedition to the remote British Islands, he would have been shocked that the native peoples use the same word for siny and goluboy; if pressed, a native English would say that one is ‘dark blue’ and the other is ‘navy blue’, but that these aren’t two different colours, but two different shades.

The idea that our ‘defective’ vocabulary has anything to do with our defective vision is nonsense. It’s simply that cultural conventions regard these as shades of the same colour. With the advent of technology, these colours are understood by a computer to be [#000000](https://www.color-hex.com/color/000000) and [#000080](https://www.color-hex.com/color/000080): the names of colours are just language conventions in a world were we are able to relate different colours to different things; given that we can see better than we can taste, we attach different colours to different things but not so many tastes to so many dishes.

The ancients could see colour as well as we do; differences arise because of cultural conventions, not biological ones. Culture can solve all mysteries, but one: Geiger’s sequence.

Instead of addressing the question, anthropologists chose to ignore it.

> This turn of events […] must be viewed in the context of the seismic shifts in world view […]: the profound changes in attitudes towards so-called savages and the growing abhorrence of any hierarchies that graded ethnic groups according to their alledged degree of evolution, a term that among anthropologists was rapidly becoming a dirty word.

[Heidegger](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heidegger/), [Foucault](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/foucault/), [Lyotard](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lyotard/)… the postmodernism arises as a reaction of the two World Wars and the colonialism of the Victorian era. An attitude of skepticism, irony, and rejection toward the assumptions of Enlightenment rationality pervades society, and the received opinion in the 19th century, that ‘savages’ were anatomically inferior, not fully evolved humans, began to change in the early years of the new century.

Gradations of different cultures were decidedly out, and Geiger’s evolutionary progression was felt to be exactly just that: it placed different languages on a straight hierarchy, and the thought that in this particular case it might be true must have been embarrassing.

> A suggestion was made that Geiger’s sequence may have been just a coincidence […]. But merely the hope that counter examples might crop up one day was considered a good enough reason not to bother with explaining the inconvenient parallels in the development of colour vocabulary among so many unrelated languages.

Just imagine if that were true: English has three colour concepts, ‘yellow’, ‘green’ and ‘blue’. If that division is merely arbitrary, we would expect it to be no more common among the world’s languages than, say, ‘grellow’ (green + yellow), turquoise and sapphire. So why are there dozens of languages that do things roughly like English, but none with the alternative?

All that changed in 1969. It’s been more than a hundred years since Geiger’s speech, and a book called Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution is published, becoming an instant sensation in linguistics. Having sensed the absurdity of the claims about arbitrariness in colour vocabulary, its authors Brent Berlin and Paul Kay set out to do some systematic comparisons. Their analysis led them to two startling discoveries.

1. Colour terms weren’t so arbitrary: Some ways of dividing the spectrum are still far more natural than others.

2. Language acquire the names of colours in a predictable order: They refined Geiger’s prediction about yellow and green, but essentially they rediscovered him, a hundred years later.

The sequence that had avoided the debate in the 19th century was suddenly brought back on stage. Berlin and Kay’s findings swung the pendulum all the way back to nature, arguing that underlying the superficial divergences in boundaries, there is a far deeper commonality, indeed universal, that was revealed in what they called the [foci](http://imbs.uci.edu/~kjameson/ECST/Hardin_BerlinKayTheory.pdf) of the different colours. Some shades, they say, are ‘more typical’, and people find them better to represent a group of similar shades of that colour encapsulated in a word, and there is a surprising cross-cultural similarity in the choice of this ‘foci’.

But they may have been falling in the errors of the past. Conveniently, Berlin and Kay identified an inventory of exactly eleven natural foci: the [eleven basic colours of English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_term#Basic_color_terms). Nevertheless, following the 1969 revolution, lecture halls resounded with the new creed.

> Colour was now hailed as the most striking example for the conceptual unity of mankind.
>
> -- __Through the Language Glass__

As the number of languages grew from the 20 in Berlin and Kay’s original sample, it gradually emerged that the situation was less straightforward than they had initially proposed.

1. Many languages contradict Berlin and Kay’s sequence.

2. The 11 foci had to be reduced to only the 6 major ones: white, black, red, green, yellow and blue.

3. Even so, they were less uniform across language

4. There were languages that lump together under one concept combinations of foci that were impossible in the original model.

The great majority of languages still behave in a highly predictable way that would be hard to explain if cultures were free to divide the colour spectrum; but the belief that colour naming follows absolute natural laws has turned out to be wishful thinking: there are exceptions to almost all of the rules.

There is, for instance, something biologically special about our relationship to red: like other Old World monkeys, humans seem to be designed to get excited by it. There are sound evolutionary reasons for this: red is a signal for many vital things, most importantly danger (blood) and sex (breeding signals in many mammals). But cultural reasons also contribute to the special status of red; most words in many languages derive the word for ‘red’ from the word for ‘blood’.

> People find names for things they feel the need to talk about.

Different cultures are not entirely at liberty to carve up the world entirely at whim. With cats and dogs and birds and roses, culture hardly has any freedom of expression at all. It’s illogical to imagine a language that treats a set of birds and roses with the same word, and the complementary set of birds and roses with a different one; it feels more ‘natural’ to treat birds as birds, and roses as roses.

On the other hand, when nature is ambiguous about its boundaries, different cultures have slipped through the cracks and can divide concepts more freely.

What about the complexity of languages. Are tribal languages less complex than Western countries’? Ask the average Joe what sort of languages the half naked tribes in the Amazonian rainforest speak, and they will say something close to ‘primitive people speak primitive languages’. There is a reason for this.

For most of us, the exposure to aboriginal languages comes mainly from popular literature: from Tintin to Westerns, ‘natives’ speak in the rudimentary ‘me no come, Sahib’.

![tintin](/images/tintin.jpg)

As it happens, the aborigines do very often use a rough and ungrammatical type of language: ‘no money no come’. But what we hear these people speak is always… English. They use a rudimentary version of English, because it’s not their language!

> Just imagine yourself for a moment, eloquent, subtle, grammatically sophisticated creature that you are, trying to make yourself understood in a language you have never been taught.

There is one survival strategy that one always falls back on: strip down to the bare essentials.

No language that has served for generations as the means of communication in a society can lack a certain amount of complexity.

## Part 2 - The Language Lens

Does our mother tongue influence the way we think? In 1924, the close study of Navajo, Nootka, Paiute and a panorama of other native languages in America catapulted Edward Sapir and his colleagues to heights. Him and his student at Yale Benjamin Lee Whorf were making dramatic discoveries in a vast unexplored area in the linguistic space.

> We shall no longer be able to see a few recent dialects of the Indo-European family… as the apex of the evolution of the human mind. They, and our own thought process with them, can no longer be envisioned as spanning the gamut of reason and knowledge but only as one constellation in a galactic expanse.
>
> -- __Benjamin Lee Whorf__

Sapir and Whorf became convinced that, if people across languages speak so differently from each other, one must deduce that, beyond the conventions, there is an underlying difference in how we approach reality. If thinking is speaking to oneself, then the way we speak affects the way we think.

Sapir branded this idea the principle of ‘language relativity’, equating it with Einstein’s theory: the observer’s perception of the world depend not only on his inertial frame of reference, but also on his mother tongue. This idea wasn’t but a close rerun of an episode from the early 18th century, when it was accepted that the only languages worthy of serious study were Latin and Greek; modern European languages were viewed as merely degenerate forms of the classical ones. In the second half of the 18th century, the view was widen slightly: it’s the same time when a businessman called Emanuel Schikaneder has particular success with his Wiednertheater, in Vienna, in which a young Mozart would set [The Magic Flute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_Flute), which is for some the consolidation of German-spoken opera.

It’s also the time when remote languages were described by missionaries who needed them for practical purposes, but described in terms of Latin paradigms. The notion that American Indian languages were organised on fundamentally different principles from those of Latin was simply far-fetched.

Enter Wilhelm von Humboldt. His education imbued him with admiration for classical culture and their languages. But everything changed when he came to Spain.

> In 1799, [Humboldt] travelled to Spain and was greatly taken with the Basque people […]. Here was a language spoken on European soil but entirely unlike all other European tongues and clearly from a different stock.
>
> -- __Through the Language Glass__

Puzzled, he learnt the language firsthand; as his knowledge deepened, he realised that not all languages were made in the image of Latin. This prompted a search of even more remote tongues; he found himself becoming the Prussian envoy to the Vatican in 1802, where its library contained the manuscripts of all the Jesuit missionaries [that were expelled from their missions in South America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppression_of_the_Society_of_Jesus) less than 50 years earlier, manuscripts that contained descriptions of the South and Central American languages they had contact with.

> It is sad to see what violence these missionaries exerted both on themselves and on the languages, in order to force them into the narrow rules of Latin grammar.
>
> -- __Humboldt__, 1802.

He completely rewrote many of these grammars, and, gradually, the real structure of the languages emerged from behind the Latin paradigms. Humboldt, however, found an uncomprehending audience, which persisted in Latin and Greek, but went on to say that grammatical differences not only reflect pre-existing differences in thought, but are responsible for shaping these differences in the first place.

It won’t be the last time that causation and correlation are ill delimited. ‘Thinking’, he concluded, ‘is dependent not just on language in general but to a certain extent on each individual language’. He left his thoughts pretty much there, in philosophical generalities, perhaps because he didn’t know any better. But he wasn’t the only one.

> The words in which we think are channels of thought which we have not dug ourselves, but which we found ready made for us.
>
> -- __Max Müller__, 1873.

We would need to get to the 20th century to see these slogans turn into specific claims about the influence of language on the mind. Sapir, like Humboldt before him, started his studies concentrated on the classics, in his case German philology. However, he ‘converted’ to the Indian languages influenced by Franz Boas, his anthropology professor at Columbia. He was also influenced by the work of philosophers like Wittgenstein were decrying the pernicious influences of language on the metaphysics of the past.

> The correct method in philosophy would really be the following: to say nothing except what can be said, […] and then, whenever someone else wanted to say something metaphysical, to demonstrate to him that he had failed to give a meaning to certain signs in his propositions. Although it would not be satisfying to the other person, […] this method would be the only strictly correct one.
>
> -- __[Tractatus](/tractatus-logico-philosophicus)__

Sapir translated these claims into an argument about the influence of the mother tongue on everyday thoughts and perceptions.

> When we observe a stone moving through space towards the earth, Sapir explained, we involuntarily divide this event into two separate concepts: a stone and the action of falling. […] But the inevitability of the division into ‘stone’ and ‘fall’ is just an illusion, because the Nootka language, which is spoken on Vancouver Island, does things in a very different way. There is no verb in Nootka that corresponds to our general verb ‘fall’ and that can describe the action independently of a specific falling object. Instead, a special verb […] is used to refer to the motion of a stone in particular. […]
>
> -- __Edward Sapir__

Such examples of ‘analysis of experience in different languages’ is what, Sapir says, prove that there is ‘a kind of relativity hidden from us by our naïve acceptance of fixed habits of speech’. The Nootka expression is undoubtedly a very different way of describing a stone falling, but if we think of an analogous experience, raining for example, we noticed that there is indeed a word that mixes water and falling altogether, and nevertheless how we understand what is going on hasn’t changed a bit.

>Do you feel you are prevented by the grammar of your mother tongue from understanding the distinction between the watery substance and the action of falling?
>
> -- __Through the Language Glass__

Whereas Sapir still kept a few toes on the ground, Whorf expounded the power of our mother tongue to influence not just our thoughts and perceptions but even the physics of the cosmos.


From the frequent fusion of noun and verb in American language, like in Nootka, Whorf concluded that such languages impose a ‘monopolistic view of nature’.

>Some languages have means of expression in which the separate terms are not so separate as in English but flow together into plastic synthetic creations. Hence such languages, which do not paint the separate-object picture of the universe to the same degree as English and its sister tongues, point towards possible new types of logic and possible new cosmical pictures.

>[The grammar of each language] is not merely a reproducing instrument of voicing ideas, but rather is itself the sharper of ideas, the programme and guide for the individual’s mental activity, for his analysis of impressions… We dissect nature along lines laid down by our native language.

Let’s try this with an example. Think of your three ordinary dimensions: height, width and depth. In Physics, we usually represent them with the letters x, y, and z. With it, it is very simple to understand what are the forces that come into play when navigating a river downstream, or the dynamics of throwing boxes in a ramp. However, these ‘coordinates’ aren’t the only way to represent a given point in space. We can also use spherical coordinates r, θ and φ, that represent the absolute distance from the centre of a sphere, and the latitude and longitude degrees from two lines of reference, the meridian and the equator. Of course, with these coordinates, it gets much easier to understand not only positions on Earth, but it comes natural that there are [centripetal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_force) and [centrifugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_force) forces that are felt by an object moving within a sphere that are a consequence of the rotation of the sphere itself. Everything that rotates in any form can be explained more easily if spherical coordinates, or their 2D version, polar coordinates, come into play.

Does someone that only uses x, y, and z is prevented from understanding how a bicycle works? No, but it’ll be more complex for him to explain it. The main point here is that a different frame of reference doesn’t prohibit someone from understanding some idea. It will be harder to explain, and probably harder to understand, unless that frame of reference is changed.

The fallacy is believing that, given that some concepts are easier to express in one language than another, it follows that our languages are cages from which we can’t escape. This can’t be further from the truth: we argued in [How To Read a Book](/how-to-read-a-book) that, indeed, language is an obstacle. But any language, as a tool sharpen by our communicating with each other, is pliable, malleable, ductile, can accommodate new concepts that didn’t exist before with ease, and allows those new ideas and ways of speech to be included into our ‘frame of reference’. It can only follows that any language is prepared to use any concept, but in some languages these concepts are expressed in more or less complexity.

![Schadenfreude](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Eduardo_Zamacois_y_Zabala_-_Regreso_al_convento.jpg/2880px-Eduardo_Zamacois_y_Zabala_-_Regreso_al_convento.jpg)

This idea is nevertheless perverse, and many writers have fallen for it. If in [Politics and the English Language](/politics-and-the-english-language), we talked about how speech affects thought, we are now convinced that things aren’t as simple as that. George Orwell’s [1984](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nineteen-Eighty-Four-Penguin-Modern-Classics/dp/014118776X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1548960652&sr=1-1&keywords=1984), in which the political rulers assumed political dissent could be weed out by expunging all offending words from the vocabulary, elaborated on his short essay.

Any idea can be expressed in any such form, in any language. Some are simple and ambiguous (populism aims toward that), and some are more complex and elaborate. But in the end, all roads lead to Rome. This is already understood in Computer Science: Most computer languages are [Turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness), which roughly mean that any programme defined in any of those languages can be ported, somehow, to any other language that is Turing complete.

Gravitating around these ideas we find the works of Francis Boas and Roman Jakobson. In 1938, Boas wrote that ‘[grammar] determines those aspects of each experience that must be expressed’. English is pretty much gender neutral, unlike many Latin languages like German, French or Spanish. He went on to explain that languages varied in those such obligatory aspects, signalling what eventually became [Chomsky’s Minimalist Program](/the-architecture-of-language).

> If I say in English ‘I spent yesterday evening with a neighbour’, you may well wonder whether my companion was male or female, but I have the right to tell you politely that it’s none of your business. But if I we are speaking French or German or Russian, I don’t have the priviledge to equivocate, because I am obliged by the language to choose between voisin* or voisine, Nachbar or Nachbarin, sosed or sosedka.

If different languages influence their speakers’ minds in varying ways, it’s in the kinds of information each language habitually obliges people to think about. Such habits of speech can eventually settle into habits of mind with consequences for memory, or perception, or associations, or even practical skills.

How? That’s where the road ends. Boas was concerned with the role that grammar plays in language, and Jakobson was dealing with the challenges in translation. Inferring anything from this is pure speculation, and we find ourselves outside the black box that our brain is, trying to understand it in the same plane of reality that our thinking tool lives.

In [The Stuff of Thought](https://www.amazon.com/Stuff-Thought-Language-Penguin-Science/dp/0141015470?SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&tag=duckduckgo-ffab-es-21&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0141015470), Steven Pinker argues that since no one has ever managed to show that speakers of one language find it impossible to reason in a particular way that comes naturally to other speakers of another language, then any remaining effects of language on thought are mundane.

We need to refer back to our system of coordinates. That’s how we express ourselves: through a system of conventions agreed upon. This agreements are complex enough to convey ideas with granular detail and flexible enough to be broken into pieces and reassembled to form new meanings (most languages form words by means of common roots; my favourite is the German word for fridge, Külschrank, literally ‘cold closet’). It’s a living tool, in the sense that it isn’t definite. It’s part of our culture in the sense that we the act of speaking shapes our language.

Given that language is learnt when we are kids, we use it to think; one can only truly master a new language when he stops translating each sentence into his own language to ‘read’ it and starts ‘thinking’ using the new language. That only comes through practice. But practice itself is what makes the line that divides thoughts and speech fuzzy: where does learning a new language becomes a new way of thinking?

We are prone to jump from correlation to causation. We can’t go anywhere closer to the truth than this: we know that we think different if we speak different, but once we find ways to speak the same language, these different thinking vanishes. What can that tell us about the relationship between our thoughts and our language? The answer is ‘very little’. Maybe left and right are concepts that kids find hard to get used to, and so do differences in colours, probably because we take for granted concepts that were learnt when we were their age.

The field of colour, as we said earlier, has proven that the unfamiliar may not always be unnatural. We are left with social science, which doesn’t stand on solid ground at this point, mostly because it’s task is insurmountable given current tools: thinking about thinking.
