Most people would agree that language is in bad shape. It's also agreed that we cannot do anything about it. It's believed that it grows naturally, like a junglelike forest, and not something that can be gardened in any way.

In this short essay called [Politics and the English language](http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit), George Orwell aims at proving all these people wrong.

> [The modern English writer] either has a meaning and cannot express it , or he inadvertently says something else, or he is almost indifferent as to whether his words mean anything or not.

[Politics and the English Language](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0141393068/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0141393068&linkCode=as2&tag=alvaroduran-20&linkId=97e3deadf7b55b0f5210d42672ce7ebc) was published in 1946, nearly simultaneously with another of Orwell's essays, [The Prevention of Literature](http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/prevention/english/e_plit). In both essays, Orwell expresses his concerns about how truth depends upon the use of language, and highlights the deliberate misuse of language to sway the public opinion.

Introductory writing courses frequently cite this essay, and it has had a large impact on classrooms, journalism and other writing, due to the highest standards that the author imposes, even to himself.

> Look back through this essay, and for certain you will find that I have again and again committed the very faults I am protesting against.

It consists of two parts: one related to the English language itself, and another one related to the Political language.

### Part 1 - The English Language

Our language has become ugly and inaccurate because we aren't in the habit of thinking what we say. We discussed about it in [How to Read a Book](/how-to-read-a-book)

> The packaging of ideas is [the media's] production. The viewer of television, the listener to the radio, the reader of magazines, is presented with a whole complex of elements to make it easy for him to ‘make up his own mind’ with the minimum difficulty and effort.
>
> -- __How to Read a Book__

This 'packaging' is very effective: throughout the years, media has found a way to ease up thinking in the consumer, and the viewer, listener or reader does not make up his mind. He, instead, gets a packaged opinion inserted into his mind, like a new song into the playlist, so that he can 'play it back' whenever appropriate.

> [Our writing] becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish , but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts.
>
> -- __Politics and the English Language__

We must make a constant effort to get rid of the bad habit, which presents itself in several forms:

1. __Dying metaphors__: there is a huge dump of worn-out metaphors without evocative power that are used because they save people the trouble of inventing phrases for themselves: *stand shoulder to shoulder with*, *fishing in troubled waters*. Many are used without knowledge of their meaning or incompatible metaphors are mixed, a sure sign that the writer is not interested in what he is saying.

2. __Operators__, or verbal false limbs: *render inoperative*, *militate against*, *be subject to*, *give grounds for*. The keynote is the elimination of simple verbs. Instead of being a single word, a verb becomes a phrase; simple conjunctions and prepositions are replaced by phrases such as *with respect to* or *having regard to*; and the ends of sentences are saved from anticlimax by *greatly to be desired* or *cannot be left out of account*.

3. __Pretentious diction__: Words like *phenomenon*, *element*, *exploit* or *utilize* are used to dress up simple statements, and give scientific impartiality to biased judgements. Adjectives like *epoch-making*, *epic*, *historic*, *triumphant* are used to dignify the sordid processes of international politics, while writing that aims at glorifying war usually takes on an archaic colour: *realm*, *mailed fist*, *banner*.

4. __Foreign words__: Expressions such as *cul de sac*, *deus ex machina*, *status quo* are used to give an air of culture and elegance. Bad writers are haunted by the notion that Latin or Greek words are grander than Saxon ones, and the jargon peculiar to Marxist writing consists largely of words and phrases translated from Russian, German or French. It is often easier to make up words of this kind (*deregionalize*, *impermissible*, *extramarital*) than to think up the English words that will cover one’s meaning.

5. __Meaningless words__: Words used in art criticism are strictly meaningless, in the sense that they not only do not point to any discoverable object, but are hardly even expected to do so by the reader. Many political words are similarly abused: the word *Fascism* has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies ‘something not desirable’, and the words *democracy*, *socialism*, *freedom*, *patriotic*, *realistic*, *justice*, have each of them several different meanings which cannot be reconciled with one another. Words of this kind are often used in a consciously dishonest way: the speaker has his own private definition, but allows his hearer to think he means something quite different.

Modern prose tends to be abstract rather than concrete. At their worst, writers do not pick out words for the sake of their meaning, but glueing long chains of words already prepared, precooked, prefabricated by someone else, making the result presentable, but senseless.

> The attraction of of this way of writing is that it is easy. If you use ready-made phrases, you not only don’t have to hunt about for words; you also don’t have to bother with the rythms of your sentences, since these phrases are generally so arranged as to be more or less euphonious.
>
> -- __Politics and the English Language__

Using decorations without content may save mental effort, but it will be at the expense of being vague, both to you and your reader.

A scrupulous writer, in every sentence that he writes, will ask himself at least six questions:

1. What am I trying to say?

2. What words will express it?

3. What image or idiom will make it clearer?

4. Is this image fresh enough to have an effect?

5. Could I put it more shortly?

6. Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly?

Thing is, you are not obliged to go al this trouble. Save yourself the trouble at your own risk.

### Part 2 - The Politics Language

> It is at this point that the special connection between politics and the debasement of language becomes clear.
>
> -- __Politics and the English Language__

If most people would agree that language is in bad shape, most people would also agree that political writing is bad writing. In those cases where that isn't true, it will generally be some kind of rebel expressing his private opinions, and not a ‘party line’.

Orthodoxy, of whatever colour, seems to demand a lifeless, imitable style.

> The political dialects […] are all alike in that one almost never finds in them a fresh, vivid, home-made turn of speech.
>
> -- __Politics and the English Language__

Take [Ted Cruz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yiq1Kw3-TGc), for instance: a speaker who uses that kind of phraseology has gone some distance towards turning himself into a machine, as if his brain is not involved. Like uttering responses in church.

And of course, like in church, this reduced state of consciousness is favourable to conformity.

> In our time, political speech and writing is largely the defence of the indefensible. [...] Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness.
>
> -- __Politics and the English Language__

When there is a gap between one’s real and one’s declared views, one relies instinctively on long words and exhausted idioms.

But if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought; you need to be on guard constantly: every phrase can anaesthetise a portion of one’s brain.

Silly words and expressions have often disappeared, not through any evolutionary process but owing to the conscious action of a minority, as we discussed *the minority rule* in [Skin in the Game](/skin-in-the-game)

>There is a long list of fly-blown metaphors which could similarly be got rid of if enough people would interest themselves in the job; […] to make pretentiousness unfashionable.
>
> -- __Politics and the English Language__

The defence of the English language implies more than this, and perhaps it is best to start by saying what it does not imply:

1. It has nothing to do with archaism

2. It has nothing to do with correct grammar and syntax

3. It has nothing to do with fake simplicity and trying to make English colloquial

Those are nonessential, as long as you make yourself clear. What is above all need is to __let the meaning choose the word, and not the other way around__.

In prose, the worst thing you can do with words is surrender them. When you think of something abstract you are more inclined to use words from the start (Wittgenstein, or what I understood from reading his [Tractatus](/tractatus-logico-philosophicus), is mistaking objects from the signs that symbolise those objects).

Probably it is better to put off using words as long as possible and get the meaning as clear as one can through pictures or sensations. Then, switch back and decide what impression those words are likely to make on another person.

And keep in mind these rules:

1. Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print

2. Never use a long word where a short one will do

3. Always cut a word out if it is possible to cut it out

4. Never use the passive where you can use the active

5. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon if you can think of an everyday English equivalent

6. Always break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous

These rules demand a deep change of attitude in anyone who has grown used to writing in the style now fashionable.

[Stuart Chase](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0156923947/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0156923947&linkCode=as2&tag=alvaroduran-20&linkId=59e4f003a401162329c376db84cec1e7) claims that all abstract words are meaningless, and have used this as a pretext for advocating a kind of political quietism. But you should note that the present political chaos is connected with the decay of language, and that one can probably bring about some improvement by starting at the verbal end.

You cannot speak any of the necessary dialects, and when you make a stupid remark its stupidity will be obvious, even to yourself.

Political language is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.

### Conclusion

The decadence of language is probably curable. It has simply pervaded our language, during Orwell's time and of course nowadays. You cannot change this all in a moment, but you can at least change your own habits.
