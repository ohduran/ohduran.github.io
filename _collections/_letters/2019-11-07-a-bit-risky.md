# A bit risky
Today, at work, I took the blame for something I did. It was something my manager and I understood to be easily avoidable, caused a headache for the team, and slowed down the current sprint.

What I did was **made the website simpler**.

Had I _not done anything at all_, it wouldn't have caused any problems. I would have spent no time on it, Quality Assurance wouldn't need reviewing it, and I would have been able to move on. And yet, what I've learnt today is that **the best strategy is to pay more attention, not leaving things as they are**.

Which means that, ultimately, the client gets benefited for the investment in time to make things simpler, to think things twice, to simplify the application, _as long as it doesn't cause no headaches_. Engineers have very little constraints from their managers, regardless of what they say: all they have to do is not to put their foot in it. Once you follow that simple rule, never screw up, everything is fair game. Because no one can exert any control over what only you can understand: the ins and outs of the applications.

What matters, ultimately, is client satisfaction. Farewell.
