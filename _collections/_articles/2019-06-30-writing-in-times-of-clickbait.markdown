We live in incurious times. Some would argue that isn’t true, because we are only one click away from being informed. Some would argue that in the Internet era, facts can be verified to a degree that wasn’t possible before. And yet, it feels that people do not want to know, but to be reaffirmed in what they believe. That posing questions are seen as affirmative statements that must be punished. If someone asks “What if there is no gender gap?”, all hell breaks loose on social media, and the public trial begins. Even if there is a sincere attempt to ground the argument on facts, the crowd dismiss it as fabricated and biased, or something that must be silenced for these arguments create an unsafe environment in schools or in universities.

> Note, I’m not saying that all men differ from all women in the following ways or that these differences are “just.” I’m simply stating that the distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why we don’t see equal representation of women in tech and leadership. Many of these differences are small and there’s significant overlap between men and women, so you can’t say anything about an individual given these population level distributions.

We live in incurious time. Instead of a policing state that censors all readership, It’s a crowdsourced censorship, where its own people disregard facts that contradict their own beliefs, and where contradicting common wisdom is heresy, like in Galileo’s time.

<hr>

Across all cultures, people gained a large share of their information about the world from the written word. Not all of it, though: some had to be obtained by talking to other people or looking around. But for curious people, that has never been enough. They knew they had to read too, and they did read.

However, reading has these days the stigma of an obsolete fad. TV and social media has taken over what used to be the functions of books and newspapers, just as photography took over most functions performed by painting and other graphic arts. People used to order a portrait to have a faithful depiction of themselves. Now it’s just pretentious. I believe the same thing is happening to writing a novel.

Admittedly, TV spreads information extremely well; the visual communication of news has tremendous impact. And social media has helped breaking the fourth wall, so that people can now become part of the story. We know more about the world than we used to, and if it’s just knowledge what we needed, that would be good news.

But knowledge for its own sake isn’t enough. Facts can be twisted and presented in various forms; they are sometimes statistically significant, not just plainly true in all cases. We do not have to know everything about something to understand it; too many facts are, often, as much of an obstacle to understanding as too few. And nowadays I have the sense that we moderns are inundated with facts to the detriment of understanding.

<hr>

The situation is, of course, not new. Seneca left written that “love of bustle is not industry, – it is only the restlessness of a hunted mind”. Human beings have evolved to control over the chaos that surround us by being selectively attentive to it. Not too much, because being aware of every smell and every sound, all the lights or everything that enters contact with our skin would be overwhelming. But neither too little; the predators around us, wounds that could get infected, or alarming sounds that need triggering our defences, all of that needed our undivided attention.

Everything that is habitual and familiar pass silently through our senses; what’s new, that we pay attention to. Human beings are biologically designed to crave news, because that’s the what we can recognise more easily. By making frequent contact with our peers we exchange news in order to be prepared. Gossiping might be a waste of time, but you don’t want to miss out on things that should make you panic.

Technology, like in many other cases, only amplified what was already there. With the invention of the printing press, what used to be contained gossiping turned into widespread circulation of ideas. By separating the emitter from the receiver, we stripped gossip from its accountability, and thus technology allowed for the spreading of a kind of misinformation humans weren’t, and still aren’t, prepared for: propaganda.

In the same way that early TV was simply radio with images, newspapers started as short books. During the first quarter of the nineteenth century, New York City’s leading newspaper was a fourpage daily with circulation of 2,600 in a city of 300,000.

> At 6 cents, it was something of a luxury item, which was just as well, since […] it was aimed at the city’s business and political elite. Most New Yorkers, in fact, did not read newspapers at all.

The shift consisted of turning a set of readers that were considered the customers to a wider audience that effectively became the product for others to advertise. From then onwards, advertising would join content to defray the cost of printing and distribution. Dramatically reducing the price of the newspaper wasn’t just possible, it was needed for the model to work, for anything other than a giant readership wouldn’t have been valuable to anyone. This new model made the separation between books and newspapers complete: the reader, for the book writer, is the customer; for the news agency, is the product.

See, the advertising-supported business model was a truly innovative way to fund newspapers, which fitted them particularly well because of their uniqueness: they were books, but their stories were real, and happened yesterday: they were historians of the current days.

<hr>

I remember, during my master’s, one professor defined a customer as someone who pays money. It sounds stupidly simple, but it hides the truth at plain sight: if you’re paying less than someone else, you’re less of a customer than him or her; and if you don’t pay anything, you’re not the customer at all.

If you’re in a theatre, and you pay your ticket, you’re the customer; but if you’re on the first row, and you have a hot dog on your hand, and you’ve been promised that you’ll visit the backstage before the performance, you’re likely to have paid more than someone else on the auditorium— more than those on the cheap seats. Those are known as VIPs. So, if you paid a penny for the newspaper on your hand, but Sainsbury’s paid 1 million dollars to have their latest deals on the back of the front cover, then they’re the VIPs, and you’re on the cheap seats.

This branching out of customers has ramifications that are critical for any media company. First, there is an interdependence between the newspaper reader and the advertiser: if you don’t have many of the first, you won’t have many of the latter, but if you have too many ads, that will scare out the readers. That suggests a fragile equilibrium between how many readers and how many ads you have.

Second, and as a consequence of the first, you need one to have the other, in a dog-chasing-its-tail fashion. The fact that many media companies were founded in the early twentieth century hides the fact that the barriers of entry to this particular line of business are pretty high.

Think of the movie “The Social Network”, for instance. Think of Justin Timberlake saying [you don’t want to ruin it with ads, ‘cause ads aren’t cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5fJmkv02is).

Third, economically, the only reason why a user would read a newspaper is because it’s valuable to him, and the only reason why a company would run an ad on a newspaper is because there is value to it. There is an inescapable truth, which is what individuals think is valuable cannot be predicted. You are cast away on an island, sending messages in a bottle from which you get only the money advertisers give you. You can’t tell whether what you do is valuable to the reader, or the advertiser. Big Data and Analytics are the latest trends in trying to figure out why certain messages on certain bottles make more money than others.

The newspaper business model is, hence, based on drawing the attention of a big enough readership with low price tabloids and then reselling that attention. But, as a consequence, a newspaper can only survive if it gains and holds that attention. This means that, under competition, the race will naturally flow to the more vulgar, radiant and scandalous alternative. To what end? Apparently, to none.

If we hold the old mentality that the reader is the customer, which we serve, then we must make a clear separation between what is advertising— a white lie, to say the least— and the content— the truth, if there is such thing. But if we did so, advertisers bump into an upper limit to the value of their ads, which is that people know when they are being sold something. Which, up until some point, that was as good as you could get as an advertiser.

But if we bring the readers down from the altar of VIPs and place them where they belong, then news agencies must channel the attention towards the ads being run on the newspaper. The separation between an ad and a piece of news must be blurrier. Ads must look like the news.

By blending the ad into the content, native advertising makes many readers unaware they are looking at an ad to begin with. When done well, advertisers get more out of their investment because good publicity is one that sounds like advice. If we considered a newspaper as real state, then native advertising makes any location increase in value.

Let’s take the analogy a bit further. Let’s imagine that I want to get the most value of a piece of news, placed anywhere on the tabloid. How would you go about it? In terms of real state, cities know it better: you would like to have parks, libraries, police stations to bring crime rates down, firemen stations, etc. These are analogous to content: the advertiser pays for them to be there, but gets nothing out of it, only the bait to attract the reader.

In order to make the most of any piece of land, you must turn them into mansions. That way, anywhere you look is occupied by individuals that give you lots of money for where they live, even if a twenty-room house is more than what a couple and two kids need in order to live comfortably. The analogy is good in this case, because newspapers try to do just that: they turn every piece of content into something you want to read, even if that isn’t what you really need. Even if it’s a lie.

In real state, things are what they are; families that bought a mansion that turned out to be the house of horrors will promptly leave. But information isn’t tangible. You can get away with a lie for an indefinite period of time. What you need to do is tap into some of the metaphorical levers that evolution has placed in humans’ minds and you’re good to go. A reckless and methodical industry will eventually figure out a way to tap on them, and make certain lies something you want to believe are truth.

Fake news is what you get when you’re not the customer. If you were, and you were recurrently lied to, then you would vote with your feet for some other newspaper. There would be someone that give you what you want in exchange for the value that you perceive it has.

In that sense, both the newspapers and us are at guilt: it feels that neither of us think that content is valuable in itself.

<hr>

Are we placing so little value on being well informed, that huge amount of people don't hold the newscasts accountable for the news they are given? Or worse: are we so reckless, that we have delegated the decision of what we need to know in the hands of someone else?

Journalism supported by advertising took off on the assumption that the masses are simple and demand simple things to be entertained. They want circus, not academia; they want gladiators, not professors. The hypothesis, held to this day, is that daily stories need a baseline of drama, a look into the spectacular, for them to appear on the news. Mere facts don’t cut it; the masses want suicides, murders and rapes. Never mind the dubitative scientists; the masses want conviction and “to be told like it is”.

Have we chosen to live this way? Well, in a way. The main critics of TV news when I was younger pointed out that we knew very little about what really matters. “Tell us about the war in Africa”, they said, “Rwanda has been at war for 40 years, and no one knows it”. The answer, in one form of another, was: “People don’t care”. But did they? Fact is, we couldn’t care if we didn’t know, so we didn’t care. We relied on the newscasts to tell us what is important and what isn’t, and for that we are guilty. Every time we sat in front of the TV, we said “this is good enough for me”.

It’s tough to figure out that the news are paid on the supermarket.
