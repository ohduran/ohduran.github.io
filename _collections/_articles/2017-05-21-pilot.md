At some point, Physicist became curious about the real world. And that changed everything:

1. Brian May formed Queen in 1970

2. Tim Berners Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989

3. Kip Thorne helped producing the movie ‘Interstellar’ in 2014


There are physicist everywhere. The world has changed, we don’t send astronauts anywhere, and everything seems pretty much discovered, aside from tiny slices of the first second after the Big Bang, and new and weird small sub-atomic particles that will eventually turn nuclear physicists into I-know-every-flower gardeners.

We ran out of questions to be answered with our bare hands. How about more mundane questions like: “Where is the stock market going to be tomorrow?”

So yes, I used to be engaged in Physics because it is absolutely great: it is pure and deep knowledge, rooted on Nature and experimenting.

The bachelor had nothing to do with that. At least, not in my university. It was closer to an outlandish combination of The Big Bang Theory and The Office, minus the laughter. Professors were more into their research and couldn’t care less about their students.

The most obvious case was CS101 class. I hated it. But maybe it wasn’t all about me — it is very well known that Physics professors abhor programming, and they’d rather go for pencil and notebooks.

On top of that, common practice made it even worse. And common practice smells a lot like MATLAB: a rather slow, difficult to grasp and, worse, proprietary programming language. The best way to start coding…

So you want to start programming? Chip in.

Not even have the faintest idea if you are going to use it after the CS class? Couldn’t care, chip in.

I hated it, but I kind of enjoyed it: there is a beauty behind thinking like a computer. Electronics was the follow up on this: the difficulty about computer is that they do exactly as told, not more, nor less.

The annoying part about computers is that they are becoming smarter and smarter but, under the hood, it’s just millions of ones and zeroes. That has to mean something to what we think ourselves as humans.

Time passed; I wasn’t the best at programming, but wasn’t bad at it. Thus, MATLAB license expired, and I could not care less. C++ programming in CS201 didn’t do anything to change my opinion about it: the professor gave us a few examples of what I thought then was pointless algorithms to calculate differential equations, we had to copy them from the blackboard onto our screens, and compile: if everything goes well, you were granted recess. Sweet.

That’s why, a few years later, when I was introduced to Python by someone from work, I despised those professors’ guts. Python was available back then, free, easy to use, and very friendly for the newcomer programmer.

No memory allocation. Not a single fuck about `<including namespace std>`. Just do your loops and print the result. The computer will handle the rest.

Here comes me, now: I know a lot about statistics, advanced mathematics, and linear algebra. I can handle that sort of maths because I was trained at it, moulded by it. By the time I finished my MSc in Finance, I had seen a lot of statistical analysis that could be very useful, not just to code my way to financial markets, but more, much more.
