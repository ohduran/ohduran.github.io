I've always dreamed of a home office. Even when I was a kid, when my parents decided it was time to move out of a flat and into a house, they thought it was a good idea that I had my own 'laboratory'. Like Dexter's (I was 10 back then). Probably the expectations were too high, as I was scheming a tunnel that would start at my bedroom and would dress me, and feed me, while carrying me into the laboratory, in the blink of an eye.

Obviously when I was living in London, like so many like me, I had to settle for having just a small room for myself, but now the conditions are adequate and I have my own home office, my own laboratory. The expectations are now far more real that they used to be: a small, minimalistic room, with a table bought at Ikea and a small window that would bring some light without distracting me. The perfect place that would allow me to go deep into my work.

Now settled in Barcelona, I think I found such a place: we are living in a flat that used to be shared by three tenants, with three bedrooms. Now, consider that my girlfriend and I share a big bedroom, and her brother has his own space, that leaves the small room with the small window as my home office. Which is absolutely fantastic: a small bedroom, the Ikea table, and lots and lots of shelves to store the endless array of books that I have collected (or plan to collect).

Let's commemorate the long-held dream of having my own laboratory by acknowledging how lucky am I to have such a space just for me and my thoughts...
