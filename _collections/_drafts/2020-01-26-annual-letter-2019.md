  *To you, the reader:*

It's time, again, to talk about time. Time that I don't have. Time that leaks through my fingers, because there are so many things, and so little time.

"How can I get from here to there?", I asked my mentor, recently. "It's a matter of time, and keep learning". And I am building a habit of building new things, learning new things, experiencing new things, but 24 hours in a day aren't enough if I want to be in shape, both physically and mentally, and spend quality time with my family.

My problem is, essentially, everyone's problem. And the only solution in the horizon is dealing with my trade-offs one by one: there is no such thing as making time. There's only doing more of that, at the expense of doing less of that other. I write less, because I'm listening more; but while listening, I cannot make up my own mind about things. And there are always 8 hours every weekday that I'm at work, pushing in one direction.

The only real question is likely to be whether those 8 hours are moving the needle in the direction I want it to be moved.
