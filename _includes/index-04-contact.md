Blogs are a two way conversation, so I welcome email and comments, as long as they're on topic, more or less. To get in touch, make time to compel a good case, and please [email me](mailto:{{ site.email }}) right away. Be aware, though, that [I may not be able to reply](/email).

To send an email that prompts a response,

1. __Ask specific questions, not vague requests, [the John Skeet way](https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2010/08/29/writing-the-perfect-question/)__

2. __Don't use jargon with me, [use the Feynman Technique](https://fs.blog/2012/04/learn-anything-faster-with-the-feynman-technique/) instead__

3. __Have a little [patience](https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/10/22/conversations-with-kafka-love-patience/)__
