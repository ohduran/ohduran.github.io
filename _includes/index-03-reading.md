Like Groucho, I find television very educating: every time somebody turns on the set, I go into the other room and read a book.

But I don't read for the sake of it; I want to learn something. That's why I write down notes on the books I've read.

I also follow a fascinating Icelandic tradition of spending time reading on Christmas Eve called [Yule Book Flood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B3lab%C3%B3kafl%C3%B3%C3%B0), so I have written condensed notes under that topic.

I really hope that you enjoy these [notes](/reading).
