Like Groucho, I find television very educating: every time somebody turns on the set, I go into the other room and read a book. But I don't read for the sake of it; I want to learn something.

That's why I write down notes on the books I've read: they are steps on lengthy projects of understanding an idea in great depth.

You can read more about my reading playbook [here](/my-reading), or find all of my notes alphabetically sorted in the [Reading Archive](/reading/all).
