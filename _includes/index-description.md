I'm a Software Engineer and a Data Science mentor.

This site hosts articles on [Technology](/index-technology), [Science](/index-science), notes on [books I've read](/index-tags), and long-form [essays](/articles) based on those notes.

I've built this website from scratch, [check it out](https://github.com/ohduran/ohduran.github.io).
