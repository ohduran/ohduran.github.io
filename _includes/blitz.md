Multiple cultures across the globe have traditions that revolve around reading:

1. It's customary in many countries to celebrate the [World Book Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Book_Day) by giving away books to your loved ones.

2. During Christmas Eve, Icelanders celebrate [Yule Book Flood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_Christmas_book_flood), a tradition that consists of exchanging books and spending the rest of the night reading it.

Once in a while, I double down on my reading habits and reflect on a short essay or book, something that could take half an hour from cover to cover, and jot down my notes. They are short, but condense. I hope that you enjoy them.
