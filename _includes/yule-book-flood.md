In Iceland, __Yule Book Flood__ is a tradition that consists of exchanging books on Christmas Eve, and spending the rest of the night reading it.

I allocate some time during Christmas to read one short essay or book, something that could take me around half an hour, and jot down my thoughts. These are the resulting notes.
