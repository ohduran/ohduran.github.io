# Words versus Terms
When talking about other people's books, my approach is to write those notes as I were rewriting the book myself.
That's a good way to grasp completely what the author means, rather than just the words that are written.
A consequence of that approach is that all the opinions expressed here come as a result of my interpretation of what the author means by his words.
It doesn't mean that the author indeed said what I interpret, but neither does it mean that I agree with what I interpret that the author is saying.

The views and opinions expressed here are, of course, not necessarily my employer's.
