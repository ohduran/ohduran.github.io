To get in touch, make time to compel a good case, and please [email me](mailto:{{ site.email }}) right away. I'll reply back only if I'm convinced that you are genuinely interested in having a conversation with me. Otherwise, [I may not be able to reply](/email).

Consider this a spam filter: there's enough friction so that those who eventually send an email have spent some time thinking about what to say, and they aren't just [spraying and praying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spray_and_pray) for my attention.

Such an investment in time comes with a promise: that I'll deliver a response that will be, to the best of my ability, the most efficient for bringing your request to a successful conclusion.

To send an email that prompts a response,

1. __Ask specific questions, not vague requests, [the John Skeet way](https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2010/08/29/writing-the-perfect-question/)__

2. __Don't use jargon with me, [use the Feynman Technique](https://fs.blog/2012/04/learn-anything-faster-with-the-feynman-technique/) instead__

3. __Have a little [patience](https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/10/22/conversations-with-kafka-love-patience/)__
