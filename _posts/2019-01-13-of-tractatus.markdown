One thing that I've noticed about the notes I wrote for Wittgenstein's [Tractatus](/tractatus-logico-philosophicus) is that people jump into wrong conclusions pretty early when deciphering it. One way to approach the book is to see it as the leap into the abyss of the consequences of assuming true that __we are conscious thinkers__.

Only after we think, we speak. Which is quite obvious, I reckon: unless you have thought about something, you can't speak. Whether that is true or false has nothing to do with what we say. We lie, right? Moreover, we sometimes lie while believing what we are saying, which makes the work of a polygraph [pretty difficult](https://antipolygraph.org/).

Some part of what we say is true, and some isn't. What Wittgenstein says is that the world consists of what is true, because what can be thought and what exists overlap, but not completely. Which is weird, because we can think about things that are not in our world, and we can do it effortless.

How is that possible? For Wittgenstein, that's because the world, our language and our thoughts have something in common, what he called the 'logical form'. They mirror each other, and logic enables our language to communicate something that we thought to someone else so that he can think about it himself. That is possible only if the structure of our reality has something that is common ground. Some logic to it. If I ask you to imagine a new colour, you can't. And I can't either. That's why you know I'm teasing you; it's not logical.

The idea that we think by speaking to ourselves is critical. We cannot think: we speak. They cannot be disentangled, __because they are the same thing__. No wonder why people write diaries: they are thinking out loud. 'We picture facts to ourselves' encapsulates the idea that minds are in the business of *representing things*.

For moral values, this implies that our thoughts are either logical or nonsense, and given that moral values aren't logical... well. Philosphers make big claims about what things __must__ be, but something being true or false has nothing to do with *what* they are. Things just *are*. Truth or falseness aren't properties of things; something being true or false is accidental. Thus, moral is nonsense.

Many philosophers have attacked the Big Questions without realising that the real work of a philosopher is not about the content, but the medium: not add, but clarify what we talk about. Those 'must' are senseless.

Philosophy has tried tirelessly to talk about what we cannot talk about meaningfully. The Big Questions simply cannot be answered.
