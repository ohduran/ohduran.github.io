> We don’t read our kids a 10 point list on how to be a better person; we tell them a story.

Reading is all we do. Website, TV ads, fine print, big billboards, papers, newspapers, old hardcovers. Reading is everywhere. We can't escape it. And yet, we aren't taught how to excel at reading. We can recite Shakespeare parrot-fashion, but we haven't dug deeper into it; we go through life reading, but our reading goes through us too; we all have passed the beginner's level, but there are few masters among us.

Some people say that reading has lost its shine. We read from time to time, out of the corner of our eyes. Everything is video nowadays, and we have the feeling that Internet is a good substitute to knowledge, as it can provide someone with enough insight to get going, with access to experts, with a variety of options, into packaged bits of ideas, easily digestible.

But we became too good at it; the consumer doesn't need to make up his or her own mind anymore. Instead, he is left with a slogan that can be learnt and eventually 'played back' whenever appropriate.

The consumer is relieved from thinking, because thinking is hard. It takes courage to think.

Being able to read is something harder than what we do with a newspaper. It's lifting yourself up, from information to insight, from clichés to timeless wisdom.

This is an opinionated playbook on how to read. But it's not about reading.

## Quality trumps quantity

Most people wander through books like tourists in a museum: they rush from picture to picture recklessly, and they take pictures that they will never look at later. That makes the time spent in those museums useless; a waste of time. Extrapolate this mindset into taking selfies while in the Taj Mahal, spending time editing the #ootd picture or holding everyone in front of their plates they're about to eat so that you can take a snapshot to upload it to your profile, and the prospects of a meaningful life seem bleak.

It's no wonder why Reid Hoffman, founder of LinkedIn, said that [social media does best when it taps into one of the seven deadly sins](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303657404576363452101709880). We are prone to them; it could be morally reprovable, but it usually feels the easiest behaviour.

If most people read like they wonder in museums, reading well is like pausing in front of each painting, looking at it closely. You probably 'see' less, but you certainly understand more.

Like skiing, reading well feels weird at first. You won't be able to coalesce a lot of different components into one smooth performance, unless you have mastered each of them separately. But there is no chance to modularise learning into parts, so what you have to do is focus on one at a time.

So let me define first what I mean by reading, so that we ca both benefit from looking at it from the same angle. __Reading is learning from an absent teacher__. The reader is like a catcher in a game of baseball: one reader is better than another if he demands more of himself and of the text he's looking at. A good reader learns from what the author wrote, but the way he does so is by becoming himself the teacher to himself. By the time he is done with the book, an ideal reader has to have become an expert on the topic. He can do it only by having procured himself with a version of the book *written by himself*.

If you ask a teacher a question, he will probably answer it. If you are confused, you can save yourself the trouble of thinking by asking him what he means. If, however, you ask a book a question, you must answer it yourself. In this respect, a book is like nature: that’s why active reading closely relates to actual research.

There are two possible scenarios when you are confronted with any book. Either you understand perfectly everything, or you don't. If you do, you might have learnt new facts, but nothing else. And in times where every fact is one search away, that kind of reading is pointless.

But if you don't understand everything perfectly, what you can do? Well, you can take it to someone else who may explain the parts that trouble you. The purpose of reading is *becoming that someone else*.

To be enlightened is to know, on top of the facts, what it is all about: what its connections with other facts are, in what respects they are the same or different, and so on.

When choosing what books to read in order to learn about a topic, we are confronted with a paradox: __you don't know whether a book is good unless you read it__. Our curiosity is running through an infinite and chaotic maze, and we only get to see you've hit a dead end *when you hit it*. We need a strategy, a set of rules that can guide us from where we are to where we want to be.

That's why we should be prepared to read the book 3 times.

## First Reading: Fast

The only way to solve this paradox is failing fast. If there is a process to find whether a book is worth it that we can apply when we are wondering in a bookstore, that would be wonderful. It would not only save us the time that would be wasted reading it, but also the money employed in buying it.

This first reading is done fast. We will call it Inspectional Reading; the aim is to get the most out of a book within a given time. Inspectional Reading is the art of *skimming*.

With this first reading, we are concerned with answering two questions: '__What is the book about?__' and '__Is the book worth my time?__'.

The habit of skimming should be fairly easy to adopt. Here is a checklist to guide you.

> 1. __Look at the Title and its Preface__
>
> 2. __Study the Table of Contents__
>
> 3. __Check the Index__
>
> 4. __Look at the chapters that seem to be pivotal__
>
> 5. __Read the Epilogue__
>
> 6. __Turn the pages, dipping here and there__
>
> 7. __Find a popular review of the book and read it__

We progressively gain understanding at each step of the list. Upon analysing the title, we can tell which category does the book belong to, and studying the table of contents allows us to have a map that would guide our reading. The index sheds light about the topics covered and the books the author refers to, and with that in mind, we look at what seem the most important chapters to extract the main ideas. Finally, we look at the epilogue to wrap up. The information contained in a review of the book, if available, will give you the final pieces of information that you need.

At this point, we are in a position to answer what the book is all about, but more importantly, *whether we want to keep reading*.

If we have decided that the book is worth our time and attention, we now must *read the book through, without ever stopping to look up or ponder the things you don't understand right away*. Given that the book is difficult (only the books worth reading are), you will have a much better chance of understanding it on a follow up reading if you have read the book through at least once.

Even if you never go back, understanding half of a difficult book is much better than not understanding it at all.

If you had the high school literature experience that I had, your teacher may have spent days on end ranting, discussing and analysing pieces of writing by "The Classics", which would have dragged you down inevitably and might have even made you die of boredom. And unfortunately, that means that you have never read any of those works. By the time you reached to the end, you have already forgotten how they started. You have missed the forest for the trees.

## Second Reading: Slow

Reading is not easy. It implies an effort, a cost. However, like any cost, it can be thought of as an investment; you expect to be repaid.

The difference between a demanding and an undemanding reader would then be that the latter asks no questions, and gets no answers.

To read better, we need to form the habit of asking questions, and ask them as you read. That habit is the mark of a demanding reader; a habit that is formed *by reading*.

If Inspectional Reading is the best and most complete reading possible given a limited time, then Analytical Reading is the best and most complete reading possible given no time constraints.

This second, Analytical Reading needs a new perspective. Assuming that Inspectional Reading is complete, we are going to take notes on the book. We have questions about it, and we need to obtain answers from the book. That's why the Analytical Reading must be aimed at *rewriting the book*.

Merely asking questions is not enough. You have to try to answer them. And although it can be done in your mind, it's better if you take notes while reading.

Why is it important to take notes? It's because there is no difference between taking notes and thinking, for starters. Writing extends your memory (that's why it was invented in the first place), facilitates editing (we think about the notes we take too), and clarifies your thinking (we can weed out the bad thinking that is jotted down in the form of a note). By writing, the capacity to consider a number of ideas at the same time is expanded; they can be moved around and changed; and they can be discarded. If you are rejecting bad ideas, then you're keeping the good ones.

If you learn how to write and edit, then you will be able to tell the difference between good and bad writing, good and bad ideas, and good ideas poorly written or bad ideas well written in the form of a clickbait post.

Analytical Reading is done in three steps. One goes top down; we'll call it __Analysis__. The second one is bottom-up; we'll call it __Synthesis__. And the third consists of criticising the book fairly; we'll call it __Discussion__.

### Analysis

Analysis, in its broader sense, can be understood as isolating the fundamental components of our reading. Writing and reading are reciprocal, as are teaching and being taught: The reader tries to *uncover* the skeleton of the book, and the author starts with the skeleton and tries to *cover it up*.

During the analysis process, we aim at answering the question '*What is the book about as a whole?*'.

To do so, we first must classify the book according to kind and subject matter. For that, we'll rely on what we obtained during the Inspectional Reading, but that was just skimming. During this second reading, every sentence can be helpful in determining this.

Secondly, we have to state, in our own words, what the book is all about; the briefer, the better. Our own words imply a process of looking at the words written, thinking about them and make a conscious effort to reformulate those ideas so that we have understood them completely.

Afterwards, we must enumerate the major parts of the book, and outline these parts like we did with the book as a whole: in our own words.

And last, it is necessary that we lay out the problem that the author is trying to solve by writing the book at hand. Only once we have stated the exact nature of the problem, we are in a position to solve it.

### Synthesis

Coming to terms is usually the last step in any successful negotiation. But in reading, it's the first step beyond outlining the book's parts. For a term *is the building block of communicable knowledge*.

__A term is not a word__. A word can have many meanings, especially an important word; what you think when you think about the word 'justice' is not the same as what I do.

'Communication' is a word that's rooted in the same grounds as 'common'. Communication is an effort on the part of one person to share something with someone else, and it succeeds only when it results in a *term* that two parties share, when they use the same words *with the same meanings*.

Because language is imperfect as a medium for conveying knowledge, it is also an obstacle to communication. *Term*, then, is a word that is *used unambiguously*.

The Synthesis starts with the terms; find them. Find what are the important words for the author, and come to terms with it. What do these words mean *for him*? And *for you*? Are those meanings *the same*?

The second step is not in words, but in sentences. If we were talking in terms as unambiguous words, we use *propositions* as unambiguous sentences. Find the leading ones; find the central arguments of the solution to the problem that we outlined during the Analysis.

The natural step afterwards is, once you've found the author's arguments, state them in your own words, write them down. Only then we can be confident that they are understood and that we have come to terms with the author up to the central core of the book.

We have circled back to where we started: the main outline of the book. We've come a long way, but we aren't finished with the book just yet. It's time to emit a form of judgment of the book.

### Discussion

The works of Kahnemann and Tversky on how humans make decisions left them to conclude that we are mentally wired to take actions and jump into conclusions almost instantly, and only pause and reflect by making a conscious effort to do so.

Since men are animals as well as rational, we need to acknowledge the emotions the reader and the author brings to a dispute, or those that arise because of it. That's why discussion has to come last in Analytical Reading: __first, you must understand__.

After we have completed the Analysis and the Synthesis, if done well, we are in a position to say 'I understand'.

This is probably the easiest part; that's why most of the book reviews are done from the angle of criticism.

1. Don't disagree for the sake of it

2. Present good reasons for any judgment you make

3. If you disagree, show where the author is *uninformed*, *misinformed*, *illogical* or *incomplete*

Usually, and unfortunately, people discuss all in words, like their reading. They don’t speak *terms*. The reader is not reading to put himself above the author; rather, he should approach reading as an opportunity to learn, and __regard any disagreement as capable of being solved__.

If truth is at stake, we can safely assume that there is only one kind of it, and it isn't a matter of opinion: we either didn't come to terms or its solution is behind facts and reason. Not everyone deserves an opinion. What everyone deserves is understanding, and the opportunity to come to terms with him. But it's perfectly reasonable to say about an opinion that is true or false.

Truth is unique; we pay respect to that idea by supporting our arguments with reasons, and being open to criticism. [What we know, we know subject to correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability).

What this means is that you *must reach your own conclusions*. The end result, agreeing or disagreeing, is merely a coincidence: we have rewritten the book, and it having the same ending or not is just chance, provided that your analysis is truly independent.

## Third Reading: Read the world

When reading two or more books is where the fun begins. Initially, our idea was to learn about a topic, to scratch an itch. To get a deeper fluency on anything, you have to read more than one book; a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.

Our world is complex, and one side of the story isn't going to cut it. The paradox that we were trying to solve with Inspectional Reading goes deeper than we expected: we are poking around in fog, all the time, and knowing what books to read is usually learnt after reading.

The question then is whether we should read those unworthy books anyway. The short answer is no: there is an opportunity cost to reading. By reading a book we are giving up the time that could be use reading some other book instead.

The long answer is contained in the paradox: we have to read, and try, everything in front of us. We can separate the wheat from the chaff only if we are confronted with enough grain, but that means confronting chaff is inevitable. A good filtering process is essential in our research. That's reading.

How do we go about it? The process is iterative. We become agile in our research: our ability to change direction, steering the wheel when running into low quality books, is what makes us good sailors.

We try one book, then the other. Nowadays, technology is a tool at our disposal that floods us with options, with suggestions, with recommendations, with rankings. But ultimately, it's on us to make the most of our reading.

The process must always start with a question: [How do we become convinced of something?](/reading), [Why do we need goals?](/reading). Then, start reading. Having a roadmap might be useful, but it's only the beginning.

Sometimes, we have to accept that an author gives no answer to one or more of our questions. But that doesn't mean that he isn't implying something on the topic, or answering a different question that we might get interested in sometime later.

Believe that translation is possible, that books can 'talk' to one another (because human beings can do it) and that truth is unique, that there is an objective content of communication between human beings (because we can learn from each other); that's how this reading is possible.

### End notes

The means that will serve you in the improvement of your reading are the books you read. And reading our own minds is how we think, so maybe taking the time to read well only a few books has value, more value than passively being exposed to slogans and propaganda.

Reading also begets writing, so maybe reading well can lead to better writing, speaking and, overall, communicating with others and with yourself.

Reading is an investment, and a good book rewards you. The reward comes in two forms. First, your reading gets improved when you successfully tackle a good and difficult work. And second, a good book can teach you about the world and about yourself. You become wiser, not just more knowledgeable, in the sense that you are more deeply aware of the truths of human life.

Reading must imply caring about what you read, being selective. You are learning on your own, and are free to choose what you read, which is good and bad at the same time. You don't have reading assignments anymore.

Being proactive also means making mistakes, but that comes with choosing, with trial and error. You are prone to fail, but so long that those failures are not critical, you can get up and get going. That's how you learn.

I read about it. In a book.
