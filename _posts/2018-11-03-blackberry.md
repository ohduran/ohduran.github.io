Since I read [Deep Work](/2018/08/deep-work), I've been in a constant quest to reduce the amount of time I waste on social media and, overall, distracted. This has come as a realisation that my addiction to it was worse than I was aware of: picking up my mobile every time I had to wait or queue up was my default mode; I became conscious of how many times I was just watching a commercial on Instagram, and how many trains of thought I had in the shower compared to out of it. This had to end.

After having removed all my social media apps on my mobile, the screen looks... charmless. In fact, why having one of those killer smartphones when something a bit retro might do, for a tiny fraction of the price?

That was the moment when I thought about my old BlackBerry. I found [an article](https://www.forbes.com/2009/08/17/rim-apple-sweeny-intelligent-technology-blackberry.html#2d53e8b8863e) on Forbes that, in hindsight, is comical. Being written in 2009, the author of one of those silly books, in which society as a whole falls into the narrative fallacy, explains the "future of the BlackBerry":

>The idea of the telebrain is a brain in your pocket. Experts say the future will bring many radios on a single chip, mobile storage as big as the human brain, high-definition mobile video and wireless spectrum galore. Lazaridis [founder of RIM and creator of BlackBerry] has been funding an institute of quantum physics in Canada for years. One engineer I spoke to said Lazaridis is interested in marrying quantum physics with mobile devices. You could also call it techno-telepathy; technology that allows people to stay in such close touch, it's almost like telepathy.

That's one of the things we covered in [an essay before](/2017/10/conflicts-of-interest): media buys a lot of hype and do not understand the reputational damage this may cause. Well, a toast to Forbes. Notwithstanding the idea that quantum mechanics is __already__ in a mobile device: it explains how laser works, how a transistor works, the hard drive, the MRI, and a bulk of technologies that we take for granted nowadays, including the BlackBerry and other smartphones.

A swift break: if you were still thinking of buying the book of this poor soul, don't.

The truth is that BlackBerry took over my generation: we all had one. It's private messenger is part of history, as it's believed to be at the core of people's communication in what eventually become the [Arab Spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring) of 2010.

Part of my reminiscence comes from this: a higher standard on privacy, plus the benefit of not having to deal with highly addictive applications, because there are none that support BlackBerry OS.

But here's a thought: the network effect being built by Whatsapp is tremendous. The fact that virtually everyone in my circle uses Whatsapp forces me to use it, while at the same time forces everyone's circle that I'm part of to use it as well. This loop bans me from breaking apart from the iPhone island. I have to have it. Otherwise, I'm isolated, and the purpose of having a mobile is defeated.

I'm trapped, then, with my iPhone (first world problems). What can I do?
