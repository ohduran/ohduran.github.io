I'm in love with LinkedIn, because its technology can't be any crappier and, still, it dominates the social media market for job hunting and professional profiling.

It reminds me that the implementation of an idea as fast as possible trumps design and usability. In nowadays Internet, that is a lesson that I understand is easily forgotten. With so many people doing Agile things, it is tough to understand why people still don't get it.

And why is LikedIn has become so dominant? Because it spread out faster than anything else. If you really think it through, LinkedIn is just Wordpress for CVs, maybe with a flavour of Facebook in the form of a Wall that no one pays attention to - with the possible exception of that guy who wrote "Emotional Intelligence 2.0".

The technology is basic, at most, but the usability and the value added is huge. No more "send across your CV": LinkedIn provides a unique reference for your most up-to-date curriculum vitae, easy to search by your name. There may be lots of things that do not work well - I can write an encyclopaedia of those - but the core is so fundamental, simple and easy to get that it gravitates with me all the time.

We should stop thinking of ways to design the best application and find ways to get to market as soon as possible, so that feedback can be gathered on our proposal, and dismissed if that doesn't work.

By the way, if you want to message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alvaroduranbarata/), please do so!
