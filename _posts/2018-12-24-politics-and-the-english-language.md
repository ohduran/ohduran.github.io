> Political language [...] is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind. One cannot change this all in a moment, but one can at least change one's own habits.

Most people would agree that language is in bad shape. It's also agreed that we cannot do anything about it. It's believed that it grows naturally, like a junglelike forest, and not something that can be gardened in any way.

In this short essay called [Politics and the English language](http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit), George Orwell aims at proving all these people wrong.

> [The modern English writer] either has a meaning and cannot express it , or he inadvertently says something else, or he is almost indifferent as to whether his words mean anything or not.

> -- __Politics and the English Language__

[Politics and the English Language](http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit) was published in 1946, nearly simultaneously with another of Orwell's essays, [The Prevention of Literature](http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/prevention/english/e_plit). In both essays, Orwell expresses his concerns about how truth depends upon the use of language, and highlights the deliberate misuse of language to sway the public opinion.

Introductory writing courses frequently cite this essay, and it has had a large impact on classrooms, journalism and other writing, due to the highest standards that the author imposes, even to himself.

It consists of two parts: one related to the English language itself, and another one related to the Political language.

### Part 1 - The English Language

Our language has become ugly and inaccurate because we aren't in the habit of thinking what we say. We discussed about it in [How to Read a Book](/how-to-read-a-book)

> The packaging of ideas is [the media's] production. The viewer of television, the listener to the radio, the reader of magazines, is presented with a whole complex of elements to make it easy for him to ‘make up his own mind’ with the minimum difficulty and effort.

This 'packaging' is very effective: throughout the years, media has found a way to ease up thinking in the consumer, and the viewer, listener or reader does not make up his mind. He, instead, gets a packaged opinion inserted into his mind, like a new song into the playlist, so that he can 'play it back' whenever appropriate.

> [Our writing] becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish , but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts.

We must make a constant effort to get rid of the bad habits that we are constantly bombarded with, which present itself in several forms:

1. __Dying metaphors__: there is a huge dump of worn-out metaphors without evocative power that are used because they save people the trouble of inventing phrases for themselves: *stand shoulder to shoulder with*, *fishing in troubled waters*. Many are used without knowledge of their meaning or incompatible metaphors are mixed, a sure sign that the writer is not interested in what he is saying.

2. __Operators__, or verbal false limbs: *render inoperative*, *militate against*, *be subject to*, *give grounds for*. The keynote is the elimination of simple verbs. Instead of being a single word, a verb becomes a phrase; simple conjunctions and prepositions are replaced by phrases such as *with respect to* or *having regard to*; and the ends of sentences are saved from anticlimax by *greatly to be desired* or *cannot be left out of account*.

3. __Pretentious diction__: Words like *phenomenon*, *element*, *exploit* or *utilize* are used to dress up simple statements, and give scientific impartiality to biased judgements. Adjectives like *epoch-making*, *epic*, *historic*, *triumphant* are used to dignify the sordid processes of international politics, while writing that aims at glorifying war usually takes on an archaic colour: *realm*, *mailed fist*, *banner*.

4. __Foreign words__: Expressions such as *cul de sac*, *deus ex machina*, *status quo* are used to give an air of culture and elegance. Bad writers are haunted by the notion that Latin or Greek words are grander than Saxon ones, and the jargon peculiar to Marxist writing consists largely of words and phrases translated from Russian, German or French. It is often easier to make up words of this kind (*deregionalize*, *impermissible*, *extramarital*) than to think up the English words that will cover one’s meaning.

5. __Meaningless words__: Words used in art criticism are strictly meaningless, in the sense that they not only do not point to any discoverable object, but are hardly even expected to do so by the reader. Many political words are similarly abused: the word *Fascism* has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies ‘something not desirable’, and the words *democracy*, *socialism*, *freedom*, *patriotic*, *realistic*, *justice*, have each of them several different meanings which cannot be reconciled with one another. Words of this kind are often used in a consciously dishonest way: the speaker has his own private definition, but allows his hearer to think he means something quite different.
