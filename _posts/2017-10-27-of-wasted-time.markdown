You know what a PhD is? It literally means wasting 4 years of your life. And that's a good thing. Whilst the debate in our society is towards how to increase productivity, from our machines to the workforce, I encourage those managers who put so much pressure on deadlines to think twice.

There is no substitution for experimentation. It's built on wasted time; the whole idea is about spending some time without a clear outcome that, not surprisingly, tends to be worthless in some cases.

Nevertheless, companies focus on deadlines all the time. Why wouldn't they? The whole idea of financial value is built on the competition around. They even coined a concept, opportunity cost, to deal with the theoretical implications of "what's the competition doing?". Wasted time is wasted money, increased costs, or longer time-to-market. So, yes, experiment is not at all built in the core of average companies.

What can we do, then? Is there even a case for wasting time in the workplace?

I'm sure there is. We spend vast amounts of time commuting, for starters. I refer to another post where I rant about the benefits of working from home. We also spend a lot of time looking at our own mobile screens (around 23 days a year, according to an study), on TV... Feels like the whole construction of civilisation is keen on you not to do your job. Nevertheless, we focus on allocate that lost time on keep working, instead of doing different things with the work we do.

OK enough. We waste time, and I am just telling you that we should, not use it to work, but instead on doing something that would waste it too, but in a different way?

I do. I believe that the workplace struggles to allocate time for experimentation, and at the same time, the long term prospects of a company are built on what we are doing experiments now. The whole entrepreneurial hype is built on new ideas; however, businesses are not catching up, and keep on doing the same thing, maybe laying off people so that the company would do the same using less humans, and that would increase value.

It's obvious why this idea will come to fail. For starters, humans are humans. They can do only so much. Expecting someone to do the job for two people without giving him the adequate tools to do so will eventually lead to a not-so-great job, or constant delays, or problems. Also, relying on less an less people makes them more and more important, so expecting them to make the same salary for doing a lot more job is a market aberration that eventually will be corrected, either by the company (so, the reduced costs won't be that reduced), or by some other (hence, dramatically impacting the way the first company operates, and potentially reducing the overall value added).

But even if we give humans the adequate tools, and we accommodate their salaries to market rates, we are still behind an individual who had an idea, and is about to implement it. She's got nothing to lose: will experiment over and over, finding lots of ways of not doing it, up until the point where everything will come to work and he will chew up that lazy company's market share.

Do we really understand the importance of individuals in a world where manual labor is relentlessly assigned to machines? Do we understand that experiments are becoming crucial in the long term prospects of any company in the world?

From my point of view, companies are lagging. Elephants that move slowly onto the future, and rely too much on "how it's been done so far". They are willing to waste years trying to catching up so that they won't waste a couple of days of their daily routines. Until the moment when their routines no longer matter.
