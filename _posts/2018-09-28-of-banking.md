Here is a paradox: banks are the least capitalistic thing ever. They're a monopolistic, non competitive, ripping off industry, and they are overwhelmed by the competition that its coming, which will oust them pretty soon.

My first surprise came when, given that I recently came back to Spain, I needed to open a bank account. So, here I am, going to the branch, like in the 1970s, to talk to someone so that he can open my bank account. I was used to bank branches in the UK being opened until 5pm, so I was lucky to leave work a bit earlier and head for the bank branch.

And it was closed.

I manage to get into the internal ATMs, located indoors but not inside the office, and a patient guard told me that they opened up until 2pm.

- Wait, what?
- Yep, but that's only during summer season.

Last time I checked, 23rd September, it was already Autumn.

- And when does this summer season end?

The guard, without blinking, says:

- Late October.

Right, here I go a different day, during my lunch break, to go opening my bank account and, after queuing up for a while, I am attended by some member of staff, and get my bank account and all. But before I leave, the guy says:

- Be reminded that, unless you lock your salary into this account, we will charge you a fee.

I didn't even comment that. I didn't want to argue with that oblivious guy that the whole banking business model is about keeping my money, not incentivising me not to store it there. That the whole thing was a rip-off, and that in most EU country that is no longer a thing, unless you're giving some traits like Lloyds Bank does (cinema tickets, interests paid in your deposit, etc). I was so amazed that I couldn't even open my mouth. So I left.

My second surprise came two days later: apparently I ordered a credit card when I opened my account. No questions asked, I had a credit limit, and I could spend as much as I wanted regardless of having given no statement where it proved that I was in any way capable of repaying it.

Here's the part where I ranted my partner about how unethical that was: betting taxpayers' money that I was able to pay back, but keeping the gainings if I did so.

My third surprise came today, when I receive my salary. Determined not to keep any money in such unethical hands, I decided to transfer it to a different bank account, within the country.

It costs 10€ to move the money to a different account in the EU, and 8€ if you wanted to move the money *within Spain*, unless you cared to wait until next day.

__How many times I've been ripped off by this bank in shy of 1 month time?__

## How banks make money

If you follow the news like I do, you may already know that there's a [new CEO in Banco Santander](https://www.businessinsider.es/santander-hires-ubs-investment-bank-chief-andrea-orcel-as-ceo-2018-9?r=US&IR=T). He is portrayed this way, (actually, [the](https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/boss-santander-apos-digital-bank-105251134.html?guccounter=1) [same](https://www.msn.com/en-us/finance/news/the-boss-of-santanders-digital-bank-says-it-will-be-the-same-direction-but-faster-under-new-ceo-andrea-orcel/ar-BBNBZHU) [way](https://usa-newsposts.com/news-posts/the-boss-of-santanders-digital-bank-says-it-will-be-the-same-direction-but-faster-under-new-ceo-andrea-orcel-es0113900j/) everywhere)

> Orcel's "high-energy" reputation is well-known within banking. A Financial Times profile of the 55-year-old noted that he used to run up the hills of Zurich for half an hour a day, hoping the punishing elevations would cram 60 minutes worth of exercise into the shorter timeframe.

You would expect that the digital revolution would have come to baking at some point, but definitely that isn't the case. Here's proof.

First, the buzzwords (on the same [press conference](https://www.businessinsider.es/santander-hires-ubs-investment-bank-chief-andrea-orcel-as-ceo-2018-9?r=US&IR=T) cited above):

> We’re a super agile bank and the fact that our infrastructure is based on the cloud and it’s all machine learning — everything that the group needs to do quickly and learn, we do it.
> -- Ezequiel Szafir, CEO of Openbank (Santander digital bank)

Someone who says "our infrastructure is based on the cloud" definitely is unaware of the fact that banks need to operate on servers, and that the cloud provides the kind of advantages (instantaneous money transfer to a different bank account) that apparently are not available yet. And don't get my started on *why would they use machine learning instead of good old SQL to sort out the zillions of design problems that their architecture has*. Someone at that level in the chain of command saying that is absolutely terrifying.

Second, the doubling down of mainstream banks on having branches everywhere. As you may recalled, I had to accommodate my day so that I could go to the branch while it is opened, instead of them accommodating to me, the customer, *who pays them money to store my money so that they can make money with my money*. No wonder why 'challenger' banks are offering simple banking apps that can outperform that, and [resist so well to criticism and problems](http://uk.businessinsider.com/uk-fintech-firms-monzo-revolut-curve-loot-down-users-2017-7?IR=T). The bar is unexplicably low!

Around five days ago, I sent an email to my bank manager complaining about this, and asking them to cancel my credit card. I have receive no response since. My next step is closing my bank account. When they ask me why, I will simply say:

"I don't bank on this bank".
