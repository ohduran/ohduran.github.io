Knowledge can mean different things to different people. For taxi drivers in London, ['The Knowledge'](https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/taxis-and-private-hire/licensing/learn-the-knowledge-of-london) is the exam that candidates must pass before sitting behind the wheel of one of the famous black cabs and drive quickly through London's complicated road network. It typically takes three to four years, and those who pass it have an encyclopedic knowledge of the streets and places of interest.

Then, in 2005, Google Maps was invented. The question is: 'Is still worth it to pass The Knowledge?'

Consider the following thought experiment: a naive tourist who have never been to London jumps into a cab, and asks for directions to, say, the London Eye. You, an experienced taxi driver, know your ways into the City, but more importantly, have the upper hand: his final destination is only 5 minutes away. Do you take the oblivious tourist there by the longest and most expensive route?

Well, it's risky. It can go well, and you'll earn an extra £20, perhaps £50... provided that you don't get caught. Because if you do get caught, fire rains upon you: you lose your license, and with it, 4 years of your life learning the intricacies of the London tracks goes to waste.

Now let's do the same thing if you are armed with your brand new smartphone, which has Google Maps on it, and you're good to go as a newly hired Uber driver. Same story again, same naive tourist, same silly route that can be diverted into an extra bonus. Do you fall for it?

Of course you do. In the second case, you don't have __skin in the game__.

> Skin in the game is necessary to understand the world. Do not understand it as ‘incentives’, as it is understood in finance. It is about symmetry, like having a share of the harm, paying a penalty if something goes wrong. Having an exposure to the real world, and paying a price for its consequences, good or bad.

The book we are covering today is [Skin in the Game](https://www.amazon.com/Skin-Game-Hidden-Asymmetries-Daily/dp/042528462X), by Nassim Taleb. It's the last book of a collection called *Incerto*, an investigation of opacity, luck, uncertainty, probability, human error, risk, and decision making when you don't understand the world. If this is the first time yo stumble upon Taleb, he is definitely a unique writer, and perhaps is this book, the latest one in the series, the best gateway to the rest of the Incerto books, as it covers and summarises information from the others, leaving going more deeply into any topic as an exercise to the reader. As with any good reading, the author is going down the rabbit hole along with you, and Skin in the Game is, to me, the culmination of a journey that for Taleb started in 2001 with the publication of [Fooled by Randomness](https://www.amazon.com/Fooled-Randomness-Hidden-Markets-Incerto/dp/0812975219).

> To figure out why ethics, moral obligation, and skill cannot be easily separable in real life, consider the following. When you tell someone in a position of responsibility, say your bookkeeper, "I trust you", do you mean that 1) you trust his ethics (he will not divert money to Panama), 2) you trust his accounting precision, or 3) both?

First, skin in the game is bullshit identification and filtering: *In academia there is no difference between academia and the real world; in the real world, there is*.

Second, if you have the rewards, you must also get some of the risks, not let others pay the price of your mistakes. If you inflict risk on others, and they are harmed, you need to pay some price for it: *Don’t tell me what you ‘think’, tell me what’s in your portfolio*.

Third, the book is about how much information one should practically share with others.

Fourth, it is about rationality and the test of time, as in acknowledging the complexity of our world not through models, but through trial and error.

## __Book 1 - Introduction__

### The interventionistas

__You cannot separate knowledge from contact with the ground__, it's what the Greeks called *pathemata mathemata* (“guide your learning through pain”). However, our world is ruled by a class of people, the *interventionistas*, who rely on models to represent reality and have forgotten that __the map isn't the territory__, the idea coined by Afred Korzybski that encapsulates that the description of the thing is not the thing itself, that the model isn't the reality, and that the abstraction is not the concrete.

> A collection of people classified as interventionistas who promoted the Iraq invasion of 2003, as well as the removal of [Ghadaffi] are advocating the imposition of additional such regime change on another batch of countries, which includes Syria, because it has a “dictator”. [...] These interventionistas and their friends helped create, train, and support Islamist rebels, “moderates”, who evolved to become part of al-Qaeda, responsible for the attack on the Twin Towers of September 11, 2001.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

As explained in Christopher Phillips’ [The Battle for Syria](https://www.amazon.com/Battle-Syria-International-Rivalry-Middle/dp/030021717X), much of this foreign interference has in fact prolonged the war instead of helping win or shorten it. In the book, Phillips also gives a very good analysis of the Islamic State, noting that IS had ‘many parents’, and that if the Assad regime bore responsibility for it, so did his many international enemies, including Western countries, Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and others, who on earlier occasions supported trends which led to that movement. The story of [Barry Seal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Seal) is a testimony of the lack of scrupulousness of the US government when dealing with international affairs. It's a behaviour that you would never see in a doctor.

Interventionistas not only lack practical sense, and never learn from history, but they even fail at pure reasoning, which they drown in elaborate semiabstract buzzword-laden discourse.

Their three flaws:
1. __They think in statics, not dynamics__:

They are incapable of thinking in second steps and unaware of the need for them.

2. __They think in low, not high, dimensions__:

They can’t get the idea that, empirically, complex systems do not have obvious one-dimensional cause-and-effect mechanisms, and that under opacity, you do not mess with such a system.

3. __They think in terms of actions, never interactions__:
They can’t forecast the evolution of those one helps by attacking, or the magnification one gets from feedback.

> We end up populating what the call ‘the intelligentsia’ with people who are delusional, literally mentally deranged, simply because they never have to pay for the consequences of their actions, repeating modernist slogans stripped of all depth, like “democracy”, while encouraging headcutters.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

In that sense, they aren't that far from the 'populism' that they so vigorously criticise: its solutions resemble the mainstream handling of complex issues, and it's winning not because of a renewed approach to those issues, but because the angle, the narrative is completely brand new, removing any guilt from the people who relied on mainstream politics to solve these problems in the first place.

> __Farage__: "I know that none of you have done a proper job in your lives, or worked in business, or worked in trade, or indeed ever created a job, but listen, just listen".
__Schulz__ [In German]: "Mr Farage, just a second. Ladies and gentlemen, I do understand that you're getting emotional, but you're acting like UKIP [Farage's political party] normally act, so please, don't imitate them. Mr Farage I would say something to you: the fact that you're claiming nobody's ever done a decent job in their life, you can't really say that."
__Farage__: "You're quite right, Mr Schulz, UKIP used to protest against the establishment and now the establishment protests against UKIP, so something has happened here."

> -- [EU Parliament, in the first session since 'Brexit' in Brussels, 28 Jun 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJzRa7HWVqs&t=0s&list=PLBEF4C827963BDDD1&index=5)

The principle should be *do not harm*, not talking about [actions that would be designed to be limited in duration and scope](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/31/barack-obama-statement-us-intervention-syria). Those who don’t take risks should never be involved in making decisions, especially when we are now skilled enough to kill ourselves as a species.

It is, indeed, drawn a comparison between those interventionistas and bureaucrats. Bureaucracy is a construction by which a person is conveniently separated from the consequences of his or her actions. They love formulas because it prevents them from having to exercise judgment for which they might be blamed.

### Bob Rubin trade

When Taleb wrote [The Black Swan](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness-Fragility/dp/081297381X), he probably didn't expect the repercusion it got, but he definitely wouldn't have thought that people who read it and were in a position of power didn't understand it, especially if that includes the former Secretary of the Treasury, Robert Rubin.

> Bob Rubin, [...] one of those who sign their names on the banknote you just used to pay for coffee, collected more than $120 million in compensation from Citibank in the decade preceding the banking crash of 2008. When the bank, literally insolvent, was rescued by the taxpayer, he didn't write any check— he invoked uncertainty as an excuse. Heads he wins, tails he shouts "Black Swan"
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

The book [Other People's Money](https://www.amazon.com/Other-Peoples-Money-Business-Finance/dp/1610397150) talks about this problem in more depth, and the concept of *clawback* bonuses, that is, taking it back, possibly with an added penalty, in the event that something that results of their actions ends up badly.

This is the main consequence of bailouts: government interference in general tends to remove skin in the game. The same happened in financial markets: the risk taking business started moving toward small independent structures known as hedge funds, mostly because of the overbureaucratization of the system as paper shufflers overburdened the banks with [rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_III), but avoided considering skin in the game. In the decentralised hedge fund space, on the other hand, owner-operators have at least half of their net worth in the funds, making them relatively more exposed than any of their customers, and they personally go down with the ship. Bailing out banks have removed the last ounce of skin in the game that financial institutions had (if they had any), and, given [what happened to Banco Popular](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/23/business/lessons-from-the-collapse-of-banco-popular.html), something is rotten, forever, in banking, since the time they moved from partnerships to public companies, as told by Michael Lewis in [Liars' Poker](https://www.amazon.com/Liars-Poker-Norton-Paperback-Michael/dp/039333869X).

### Systems learn by removing

We saw that interventionistas don’t learn because they are not the victims of their mistakes. The same mechanism of transferring risk also impedes learning. And more practically, only reality can convince someone that is wrong, no argument can do that.

*The curse of modernity is that we are increasingly populated by a class of people who are better at explaining than understanding*.

It's the Bias-Variance trade-off: explaining overfits your forecast analysis, so the two are at odds with each other.

> Learning isn’t quite what we teach inmates inside the high-security prisons called schools. Evolution can only happen if risk of extinction is present. There is no evolution without skin in the game.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

We need evolution to learn, because it's easier for humans to see what is wrong than what is right. Once we've removed what is wrong, it's necessary that what is left has to be right. That's what we called *via negativa*.

### <a name="tour-of-symmetry"></a>A brief tour of symmetry

1. Hammurabi

Skin-in-the-game-style symmetry, until the recent intellectualisation of life, had been implicitly considered the principal rule for organised societies. Hammurabi’s law was posted around 3,800 years ago, and has one central theme: it establishes symmetries between people in transaction, so nobody can transfer hidden tail risk, or Bob Rubin-style risks: 'an eye for an eye'.

For, as traders, the best place to hide risks is “in the corners”, in the small letter, in burying vulnerabilities to rare events that only the architect can detect; the idea being to be far away when blowups happen. “I’ll be gone, You’ll be gone”.

2. Golden and Silver rule

The Golden Rule wants you to *treat others the way you would like them to treat you*. The more robust Silver Rule says: *do not treat others the way you would not like them to treat you*.

Why negating is more robust? First, it tells you to mind your own business and not decide what is “good” for others. Second, we know with much more clarity what is bad than what is good (via negativa).

Also, the idea of 'others' works at all scales: humans, tribes, societies, groups of societies, countries, etc…

> I go to other people’s funerals so they come to mine.
>
> -- __Yogi Berra__

Most people miss the point in Matthew 12:21-31, where a servant who has his huge debt waived by a compassionate lender subsequently punishes another servant who owed him a much smaller amount, and they mistakenly think the true message is symmetry, not forgiveness.

3. Kant

Kant’s categorical imperative can be summarised as: *behave as if your action can be generalised to the behaviour of everyone in all places, under all conditions*: as a Universal Law.

Universal behaviour is great on paper, disastrous in practice. We are local, practical animals, and we are sensitive to scale. We need practical rules; the general and the abstract tend to attract self-righteous psychopaths.

The deep message of 'Skin in the Game' is the danger of universalism taken two or three steps too far, conflating the micro and the macro, in the same way that the main idea in [The Black Swan](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness-Fragility/dp/081297381X) was *platonification*, that is, mistaking the map for the territory.

4. Fat Tony

Fat Tony is our archetype: the exact opposite of those belonging to the interventionistas. He is the stereotype of a trader like those portrayed in Liars Poker.

> [Fat Tony] became wealthy by helping people he generally calls “the suckers” separate from their funds (or as it is often the case, those of their clients, as these people often gamble with other people’s money.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

There is always an element of fools of randomness (knowledge) and crooks of randomness (ethics) in matters of uncertainty: the fool takes risks he doesn’t understand, mistaking his own past luck for skills, and the crook transfers risks to others. Economists only talk about the second one.

Reality always knows whether an action is foolish, and skin in the game is always about the real world. Similarly, there is a difference between a charlatan and a genuinely skilled member of society: the doer wins by doing, not convincing. Entire fields (most social sciences) become charlatanic because of the absence of skin in the game connecting them back to reality.

What matters in life isn’t how frequently one is right, but how much one makes when one is right. Being wrong, when it isn’t costly, doesn’t count: you’re doing research.

Exposures in real life are always too complicated to reduce to an ‘event’ easy to describe in words. It is harder for us to reverse-engineer than engineer; we see the result of evolutionary forces but cannot replicate them owing to their casual opacity, a problem that is at the core of Hume thesis: We can only run such processes forward.

Without skin in the game, we fail to get that time removes the fragile and keeps the robust, and the life expectancy of the robust lengthens with time.

What works cannot be irrational. If something stupid works (and makes money), it cannot be stupid.

5. Modernism

Intellectualism is the belief that one can separate an action from the results of such action, that one can separate theory from practice, and that one can always fix complex systems in a top-down manner. It has a sibling: scientism, a naive interpretation of science as complication rather than science as a process and a sceptical enterprise.

Using mathematics when it’s not needed is not science but scientism.

Science has been taken over by vendors using it to sell products and, ironically, the sceptical enterprise is being used to silence sceptics, as  described  in [Against the Professors](https://www.amazon.com/Sextus-Empiricus-Against-Professors-Classical/dp/0674994205).

> As things get more technological, there is a growing separation between the maker and the user.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

One of the side effects of the division of jobs proposed by Adam Smith in [The Wealth of Nations](https://www.amazon.com/Wealth-Nations-Adam-Smith/dp/1505577128/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1542738793&sr=1-1&keywords=the+wealth+of+nations) is separating labour from the fruits of labour, the concept of *alienation* described by Karl Marx's [Capital](https://www.amazon.com/Capital-Critique-Political-Economy-Classics/dp/0140445684/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1542738874&sr=1-1&keywords=capital+marx).

### Simplicity

People who see complicated solutions do not have an incentive to implement simplified ones. They are, in fact, harder to come up with, statistically speaking: it's like [parking your car](http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/794/1/falling-cats.pdf). Things designed by people without skin in the game tend to grow in complication: when you are rewarded for perception, not results, you need to show sophistication (it's one of the reasons why inexperienced people, in almost any branch of knowledge, go for the most complex solutions: they have been taught a lot of things in no time, everything is fresh and they were rewarded by perception on their tests).

When there is fire, you run faster than in any competition, and similarly, poker is a much different game when the stakes are real.

What you learn from the intensity and the focus you had when under the influence of risk stays with you. Many kids would learn to love mathematics if they had some investment in it. It's the same when learning a new language; you need to throw yourself into the wild.

### Soul in the game

> If you do not take risks for your opinion, you are nothing.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

Success is leading an honourable life. Honour implies that there are some actions you would categorically never do, regardless of the material rewards; and it also implies that there are things you would do unconditionally, regardless of its consequences. As a Spartan mother tells her departing son: “With it or on it”.

Contrast the above unconditional with modernistic accommodations: people who work for disgusting lobbies or knowingly play the usual unethical academic game, come to grips with their condition by saying things like “I have children to put through college”.

People who are not morally independent tend to fit ethics to their profession rather than find a profession that fits their ethics. That's why, regardless of the extremly cruel conditions in which Khashoggi was tortured and executed, no major government has raised any concerns about the involvement of Saudi Arabia: they are the main buyers and 'job providers' for many industries in many of these countries, in the same fashion that Russia, Eastern Europe's main provider of gas and oil, has the EU hostage pretty much every single winter.

### Entrepreneurs

Entrepreneurs are heroes in our society: they fail for the rest of us.

However, many entrepreneurs fail to have true skin in the game, as VC mechanisms remove them from the possibility of long term profitability and channel their efforts towards selling their company to the big players. The true value of the company and its long-term prospects is of small relevance.

One of the reasons corporations have the mortality of cancer patients is the assignment of time-defined duties: once you change assignment, Bob Rubin emerges: “It’s not my problem anymore”.

### How the book is organised

Skin in the Game is organised in sections, or books, with Book 1 being the introduction that we have gone through already.

__Book 2__ is a deeper exposition of symmetry and agency in risk sharing, bridging commercial conflict of interest with general ethics.

__Book 3__ is about the minority rule by which a small segment of the population inflicts its preferences on the general population.

__Book 4__ deals with dependence and slavery in modern life: why employees exist because they have much more to lose than contractors.

__Book 5__ shows how risk taking makes you look superficially less attractive, but vastly more convincing, the concept of “Intellectual Yet Idiot”, inequality, and the Lindy effect.

__Book 6__ looks for consequential hidden asymmetries.

__Book 7__ explains creeds in terms of skin in the game and revealed preferences, and the word ‘religion’.

__Book 8__ has the two central chapters: ‘How to be Rational about Rationality’, which goes deep into what rationality really is; and ‘The Logic of Risk Taking’, which summarises the author’s tenets about risk and exposes the errors concerning small-probability events.

## __Book 2 - A first look at Agency__

## <a name="chapter1"></a>Chapter 1 - Why each one should eat his own turtles

*Beware of the person who gives advice, telling you that a certain action on your part is ‘good for you’, while it is also good for him, while the harm to you doesn’t directly affect him*.

> I worked once for an US investment bank. As with all such firms, an image of ethics and professionalism was cultivated. [...] But the job of the salespeople was to ‘unload’ inventory with which traders were ‘stuffed’, that is, securities they had in excess in their books and needed to get rid of to lower their risk profile. Selling to other dealers was out of the question as professional traders would smell excess inventory and cause the price to drop, so they needed to sell to some client.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

As the Romans were fully aware, *plenius aqua Iaudat venal qui vault extruder merces*, “one lauds merrily the merchandise to get rid of it”.

### The Price of Corn in Rhodes

“Giving advice” as a sales pitch is fundamentally unethical, selling cannot be deemed advice. You can do one or the other, but the two need to be kept separate. As per banks and investment firms, there is the concept of Chinese Wall, in which sections within the bank dedicated to sell and advice cannot speak to each other. Just the fact that these two sections can cohabit the same building smells funny: the mechanism itself is likely to be more permeable than what they can concede.

Assume that a man brought a large shipment of corn from Alexandria to Rhodes, at a time when corn was expensive in Rhodes because of shortage and famine. Suppose that he also knew that many boats had set sail from Alexandria to Rhodes with similar merchandise. *Does he have to inform the Rhodians*?

Traders would jump quickly to 'stuff', so long as it is done to the anonymous market and the faceless non-readers, or those called “the Swiss”, some random suckers far away. There were people with whom we had a relational rapport, much like the case with domestic animals that cannot be harmed while rules on cruelty are lifted when it comes to cockroaches.

The rule should go, then, as follows:

>No person in a transaction should have certainty about the outcome while the other has uncertainty.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

Let's explore some particular cases: insider trading would be banned, and arbitrage, but if there is a weak form of asymmetry, say just an edge instead of complete certainty about the future, this doesn’t cover it, as some forms of insider trading are like these. For instance, is Robert Foster Winans, a columnist who tipped stockbrokers on the content of his columns, going against this rule?

The medieval rabbi Rashi relates the following story. Rav Safra was selling goods for sale. A buyer came as he was praying in silence, tried to purchase the merchandise at an initial price, and given that Rav did not reply, raised the price. But he had no intention of selling at a higher price than the initial offer, and felt that he had to honour the initial intention. *Is Rav Safra obligated to sell at the initial price, or should he take the improved one*?

It may not be ethically required, but the most effective, shame-free policy is maximal transparency, even of intentions. But recall what Kant said: theory is too theoretical. The more confined our ethics, the better it works.

> Sympathy for all would be tyranny for thee, my good neighbour
>
> -- __Nietzsche__

"Moral is what brings advantage to my friends", I heard someone say. For the exclusion of 'the suckers' in this conversation is not trivial: a country isn't a big city, a city isn't a big family. Athenians, when talking about 'democracy', were applying it to a restricted set of 'citizens', not slaves or immigrants, and when Jewish talk about blood, they distinguish the 'thick' from the 'thin': *we are all brothers, but some are more brothers than others*.

Free citizens, in ancient and post-classical societies, were traditionally part of clubs, and as club members know, the very purpose of it is exclusion and size limitation. What is the connotation of the President of the US being 'the leader of the free world' when freedomhouse.org estimates that only 39% of world population is effectively free?

It is unfortunate, but the general kills the particular. For whenever the “we” becomes too large a club, things degrade, and each one starts fighting for his own interest. Dunbar's number refers to that cognitive limit to the number of people whom one can maintain stable social relationships. Being somewhat tribal is not a bad thing, and we have to work in a fractal way in the organised harmonious relations between tribes, rather than merge all tribes in one large soup, like it happened in Lebanon, a country that was known as ‘The Switzerland of the East” during the 60s, and eventually faced the horrors of war in 1975 due to demographic tensions. Blaming people for being ‘sectarian’ instead of making the best of such tendency is one of the stupidities of interventionistas.

> You know instinctively that people get along better as neighbours than roommates.

> -- __Skin in the Game__

Modernity put in our heads that there are two units, the individual and the universal collective, when in reality, my skin lies in a broader set of people, one that includes my family, a community, a tribe, a fraternity, but cannot possibly be universal.

Once we've passed the limit of what we consider a 'we', communal behaviour cease to apply, and consequences described in the [Tragedy of the Commons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr5Q3VvpI7w) begin to take place. “Me” is more likely to be a group than a single person.

### Trying to remove skin in the game

There are two types of “talking one’s book”. One consists of buying a stock because you like it, then commenting on it– the most reliable advocate for a product is its user. No amount of advertising will match the credibility of a genuine user. Another is buying a stock so you can advertise the qualities of the company, then selling it, benefiting from the trumpeting– this is called market manipulation, and it is certainly a conflict of interest.

We removed the skin in the game of journalists in order to prevent market manipulation. The arguments in this book are that market manipulation and conflicts of interest are more benign than impunity for bad advice. In the abscence of skin in the game, journalists will imitate, to be safe, the opinion of other journalists, thus creating a monoculture and collective mirages.

In general, skin in the game comes with conflict of interests; the former is just more important than the latter.

Take doctors for instance; doctors don’t have that problem by themselves: medicine is fundamentally apprenticeship-based and grounded in experience.

The problem resides in the reliance of metrics. Every metric is gameable. Attempts at putting skin in the game there have brought a certain class of adverse effects, in shifting uncertainty from the doctor to the patient.

A doctor is pushed by the system to transfer risk from himself to you, and from the present into the future, or from the intermediate future into a more distant future.

You need to remember that, when you visit a medical office (and probably everyone’s office) you will be facing someone who, in spite of his authoritative demeanour, is in a fragile situation. He has no direct emotional loss should your health experience a degradation. His objective is, naturally, to avoid a lawsuit.

The doctor is pressured to treat you to protect himself. The pharmaceutical companies have managed to convince everyone that unseen consequences are harmless, when in reality the medical risks are hidden. Should you drop dead a few weeks after the visit, the doctor faces a lawsuit: thus, he is pressured to prescribe medicine to you, even if he knows deep down that it is harmful.

That is no different from the Bob Rubin trade.

The solution is for the patient to avoid treatment when he or she is mildly ill, but use medicine for rarely encountered severe conditions. The problem is that the mildly ill represents a much larger pool of people than the severely ill (and are expected to live longer and consume drugs for longer), hence pharmaceutical companies have an incentive to focus on them.

## __Book 3 - The Greatest Asymmetry__

## Chapter 2 - The most intolerant wins: the dominance of the stubborn minority

The main idea behind complex systems is that the ensemble behaves in ways not predict by its components. This is called an “emergent” property of the whole, in which parts and whole differ because what matters are the interactions between such parts.

When a group of people is gathered, and a decision has to be taken, a naive observer would be under the impression that the choices and preferences are those of the majority. What is really going on is that, usually, a stubborn minority, once it reaches a small proportion of the group, decides for the whole.

*The minority rule*: __It suffices for an intransigent minority with significant skin in the game to reach a minutely small level for the entire population to have to submit to their preferences__.

There are two main things to consider:

- The geography of the terrain matters a bit: its makes a big difference whether the intransigents are in their own district or are mixed with the rest of the population.

- The cost structure matters a bit: so long as the price doesn’t change much, the rule applies.

Let’s call such minority an intransigent group, and the majority a flexible one. And their relationship rests on asymmetry in choices: the intransigent only chooses one option between two, whereas the flexible doesn’t care.

1. A kosher (or halal) eater will never eat non kosher (or non halal) food, but a non kosher eater isn’t banned from eating kosher.

2. A disabled person will not use the regular bathroom, but a non disabled person will use the bathroom for disabled people.

3. Someone with a peanut (or gluten) allergy will not eat products that touch peanuts (or gluten), but a person without such allergy can eat items with peanut (or gluten) traces I them.

4. Cars (and even food) are advertised as “made in [your country]”, because there is a minority of people who care deeply about “our” jobs.

The method of analysis employed here is called a “renormalisation group”, the mathematical apparatus used in Physics that allows systematic investigation of the changes of a physical system as viewed at different scales, and it has been used due to the fact [that the laws of Physics that govern the atomic level are at odds with those that rule stars and galaxies](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/nov/04/relativity-quantum-mechanics-universe-physicists).

![renormalisation](/assets/renormalisation.png)

It opposes the mean-field approach, when one replaces all interactions to any one body with an average or effective interaction, sometimes called a molecular field. This reduces any multi-body problem into an effective one-body problem. The ease of solving MFT problems means that some insight into the behavior of the system can be obtained at a relatively low cost. If there is a way to make a clear distinction between Physics and Chemistry, is this: Chemistry is the result of applying MFT to Physics.

### Veto

The minority rule can also be applied to why some well known chains such as McDonald’s or Starbucks thrive: because they are not vetoed in a certain socio-economic group. They are a best worse-case divergence from expectations: if I travel to a foreign country I might risk it with some local food or play safe and take a Happy Meal. In parties, pizza and wine is the same story. Pizza is a commonly accepted food, and nobody would be blamed for ordering it in a get together. And once you have a small amount of women at a party, you cannot serve only beer. But most men will drink wine. So you only need a set of glasses if you serve only wine.

### Languages

If a meeting is taking place in Germany in a corporation that is sufficiently international, and one of the persons in the room doesn’t speak German, the entire meeting will be run, of course, in English. Because once it was settled that English was the lingua franca, native speakers lost the incentive to learn a new language, and everyone else had the incentive to learn English.

It's the same in the Spanish region of Catalonia: so long as the impact and the cost of your labelling is low (milk bricks, local TV ads, generic station announcements, display window labelling), everything is in Catalan, not in Spanish.

Language travels so much faster than genes: it shows us the recent mistake of building racial theories on language, dividing people into “Aryans” and “Semites”, based on linguistic considerations.

### Religions

The minority rules also applies, of course, to prohibitions.

*Outcomes are paradoxically more stable under the minority rule: the variance of the results is lower and the rule is more likely to emerge independently across separate populations*.

That is because you aren’t required numbers, but determination, and determination doesn’t go away easily.

*What emerges from the minority rule is more likely to be black-and-white, binary rules. (Note: Self evident*

That is Bayes Rule: conditional to the rule having been applied, it is far more likely that it came from those who imposed it, not those who compromised.

The formation of moral values in society doesn’t come from the evolution of consensus, but from the most intolerant people’s imposing virtue on others precisely because of that intolerance. In the same manner, the spread of Islam in the Near East, where Christianity  was heavily entrenched can be attributed to two asymmetries.

1. Under Islamic law, if a non-Muslim man marries a Muslim woman, he needs to convert to Islam, and if either parent of a child happens to be Muslim, the child will be Muslim.

2. Becoming a Muslim is irreversible, as apostasy is the heaviest crime under the religion.

All one needs is a small rate of interfaith marriages. Islam out-stubborned Christianity, which itself won thanks to its own stubbornness. For before Islam, the original spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire was largely due to the blinding intolerance of Christians.

> I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me
>
> -- John 14:6

Roman pagans were initially tolerant to Christians. But Christians weren’t tolerant of Roman paganism. The “persecution” of the Christians had vastly more to do with the intolerance of the Christians for the pantheon of local gods than the reverse, as described in [The Darkening Age](https://www.amazon.es/Darkening-Age-Christian-Destruction-Classical/dp/1509812326?SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&tag=duckduckgo-ffab-es-21&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1509812326)

Remember that what we read is written by the Christian side: the Constantinian shift is *fake news*.

We know too little about the Roman perspective during the rise of Christianity, as biographies of saints have dominated the discourse. There are endless accounts of Christians martyrs and saints, but very little is known of pagan heroes. Even the early Christians have been expurgated from the record, in a fashion that led Dan Brown to reveal the world what most subject matter experts already knew: that there are codices being written about Jesus Christ outside the Bible, like the The Nag Hammadi Library, which may have been hidden after Saint Athanasius condemned the use of non-canonical books in his Festal Letter of 367 A.D. We are discovering that branches such as the Gnostics had a quite different record of the early religion, closed to outsiders and secret about their own records.

This also happened much later: when Spaniards started colonising South America, they found the Incas, whose religion was mostly animistic and acknowledging gods like heavenly bodies to mountains and rivers, even ancestors. It was a religion that, being oral, was less prescriptive than those based upon books such as the Bible or the Quran.

Confronted by such certainties, backed by coercive force, the more open-ended, absorbent oral religions of Africa or the Americas were simply overwhelmed.

### Popper-Gödel paradox

In 1931, Kurt Gödel published his incompleteness theorems in "On Formally Undecidable Propositions of "Principia Mathematica" and Related Systems”. The basic idea at the heart of the incompleteness theorem is rather simple: a system cannot prove its own consistency.

*The next statement is false. The previous statement is true*.

Self referencing is always problematic, and that is at the core of Gödel’s theorems.

We've introduced this because the question is, __can democracy tolerate enemies?__ Would you agree to deny the freedom of speech to every political party that has in its charter the banning the freedom of speech? Can states allow independent parties when independence goes against the Constitution?

Should a society that has elected to be tolerant be intolerant about intolerance?

This is in fact [the incoherence that Gödel detected in the United States Constitution](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9_mR_M2zOc4Y2VhNzZkMDQtMDdlNC00YWQ0LWJlYzQtMzAxZjAxMGYxNzM5/view), while Karl Popper independently discovered the same inconsistency in democratic systems and published in [The Open Society and its Enemies](https://www.amazon.com/Open-Society-Its-Enemies-One/dp/0691158134).

Thomas Shelling [showed](https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/SchellingsModelOfResidentialSegregation/) how a neighbourhood can be segregated without a single segregationist among its inhabitants. Yes, an intolerant minority can will eventually destroy democracy.

### Markets and science

Now consider markets. Price changes reflect the activities of the most motivated buyer and seller.

All you need is a stubborn single seller to drive the price down 10%. The market is like a large movie theatre with a small door. Stampedes happen in cinemas (try shouting “fire!”) because those who want to be out do not want to be in: the same unconditionality that we see with kosher observance.

Science acts similarly: Science isn’t a consensus, but a highly skewed procedure. Once you debunk something, it is now wrong. (The reality is a bit more complicated than that: we don’t teach Newton because it’s true, but because its a gateway towards understanding Einstein better).

## Chapter 3 - How to own another person

__Complete freedom is the last thing you want if you have an organisation to run__.

Every organisation wants a certain number of people associated with it and be deprived of a certain share of their freedom. How do you own them?

1. Conditioning and psychological manipulation
2. Tweaking them to have some skin in the game, to have something to lose if they disobey

In the orders of the mafia, things are simple: made men can be whacked if the capo suspects a lack of allegiance. For other professions, skin in the game comes in a more subtle forms.

### To own a pilot

What a contractor pilot would do, selling himself to the highest bidder and leave you on your own without any shed of doubt, isn’t something that employees would. People who are employees for a living don’t behave so opportunistically. Contractors are exceedingly risk-free; they fear mostly the law. But employees have a reputation to protect, and can be fired.

Employees are reliable, but also expensive: you have to pay them even if you have nothing for them to do. Lovers of pay checks are lazy, but they would never let you down when a highest bidder appears for a one-time gig. They exist because they have a significant skin in the game, and from them you buy dependability.

Dependability is a driver in many transactions: you have a car so that you want it to be available when you need it, and so is a house on the beach useful for.

*Never buy when you can rent the three F’s: Float, Fly and Fuck*. Yet many people own boats and planes, and end up stuck in marriage.

> Evidence of submission is displayed by the employee’s going through years depriving himself of his personal freedom for nine hours every day, ritualistic and punctual arrival at an office, his denying himself his own schedule, and his not having beaten up anyone on the way back home after a bad day.

### From the companies man to the companies person

Have you ever been told to study something 'useful'? There are numerous [studies](https://bankrate.com/career/most-valuable-college-majors) on "the most valuable college majors", with the idea that *the only real path to earn a living is through being employed by someone else*. That's why Actuarial Science (aka Economics) does so well in these rankings: they are the most 'useful', whereas 'miscellaneous arts' is dead last.

Funny enough, even the wording is signaling something: the term 'miscellaneous arts' is how someone who has a degree that isn't related to liberal arts would refer to liberal arts (and you could argue that using 'miscellaneous' here is pejorative); 'actuarial science' is a term that an economist would use to peg their major to real STEM degrees like Computer Science or Engineer.

> Being an actuary is the best job in America because you get paid like doctors and lawyers, but you don't have to work with blood or visit your clients in jail.
>
> -- __Krzysztof Ostaszewski__, director of the actuarial program at Illionis State University

I never in my life have encounter a doctor defining himself as 'working with blood'. The usefulness of a degree trumps everything else.

I bring this up because we are witnessing what Taleb referred to the shift between 'the companies man to the companies person'.

> Throughout the twentieth century [firms stay in the S&P 500 for] more than 60 [years]. There was such a thing as a company man; people stayed with large firms for their entire lives.

> -- __Skin in the Game__

The company man is best defined as someone whose identity is impregnated with the stamp his firm wants to give him. A company man is someone who feels that he has something huge to lose if he doesn’t behave as a company man– that is, he has skin in the game.

In return, the firm is bound by a pact to keep the company man on the books as long as feasible, after which he would go play golf with a comfortable pension, with former coworkers as partners.

> By the 1990s, however, the technological revolution that took place in Silicon Valley put traditional companies under financial threat.

> -- __Skin in the Game__

The huge layoffs that came as the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2008 serve as the definite proof that the implicit agreement between the company man and the company is no longer valid. And with it comes the realisation that studying a pragmatic degree, regardless of its value to society as a whole, is the new normal.

> If the company man is sort of gone, he has been placed by the companies person. For people are no longer owned by a company, but by something worse: employability. The employable person is embedded in an industry, with fear of upsetting not just their employee, but other potential employees.

When conditions are dire, students turn to "occupation-specific majors", Jaison Abel, head of regional analysis at the New York Fed, [commented to the New York Times in 2016](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/education/edlife/a-brighter-job-market-for-some.html). That's how they are making sure that, wherever they go, they'll be employable. Who cares about what is your degree, so long as it gets you somewhere.

> Outside the firm, price movements direct production, which is co-ordinated through a series of exchange transactions on the market. Within a firm, these market transactions are eliminated and in place of the complicated market structure with exchange transactions is substituted the entrepreneur-coordinator, who directs production. It is clear that these are alternative methods of coordinating production. Yet, having regard to the fact that, if production is regulated by price movements, production could be carried on without any organization at all might we ask, why is there any organization?
>
> -- __Ronald Coase__, [The Nature of the Firm](http://www3.nccu.edu.tw/~jsfeng/CPEC11.pdf)

Ronald Coase was the first to shed light on why firms exist. For him, contracts can be too costly to negotiate due to transaction costs; the solution is to incorporate your business and hire employees; on the other side of the fence, a free market determine specialisation, and information travels via price point, which will cause the firm to aim for the optimal ratio of employees and outside contractors.

Had Coase had any interest in the ancients, he would have discovered that Romans had a slave for treasurer, because you can inflict a much higher punishment on a slave, and you don’t need to rely on the mechanisms of law for that.

> In a world in which products are increasingly made by subcontractors with increasing degrees of specialization, employees are even more necessary than before for some specific, delicate tasks, which explains why today things appear to run smoothly and efficiently, but errors are costlier and delays are considerably longer than in the past.

### A curious form of slave ownership

> The best slave is someone you overpay and who knows it, terrified of losing his status.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

In a famous tale by Ahiqar, later picked up by Aesop, the dog boasts to the wolf all the contraptions of comfort and luxury he has, almost prompting the wolf to enlist. Until the wolf asks the dog about his collar and is terrified when he understands its use.

> “What is that on your neck?”, asked the Wolf. “Nothing at all,” replied the Dog. “What! nothing!”, “Oh, just a trifle!”. “But please tell me.” begged the Wolf.
> “Perhaps you see the mark of the collar to which my chain is fastened.”
> “What! A chain!” cried the Wolf. “Don’t you go wherever you please?”
> “Not always! But what’s the difference?” replied the Dog.
> “All the difference in the world! I don’t care a rap for your feasts and I wouldn’t take all the tender young lambs in the world at that price.” And away ran the Wolf to the woods.

Another aspect of the dog vs wolf dilemma: a wolf is trained to survive. Employees abandoned by their employers cannot bounce back. That is why unemployment in countries such as Spain is dramatic: loads of people were laid off, loads of people who couldn’t help themselves.

![security](/assets/security.JPG)

There is a category of employees who aren’t slaves, but these represent a small proportion of the pool. One type was the salesperson whose resignation could cause a loss of business. The other type was the trader about whom only one thing mattered: profit and losses.

Note also the linguistic dimension: those who use foul language on social networks are sending an expensive signal that they are free- and, ironically, competent (numerous examples of this, of which Donald Trump is the clearest). You don’t signal competence if you don’t take risks for it. So, cursing today is an status symbol, just as oligarchs in Moscow wear blue jeans at special events to signal their power.

>  What matters isn’t what a person has or doesn’t have; it is what he or she is afraid of losing.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

Take for instance the EU leaders, confronting Russia's current president Vladimir Putin. Clearly, except for Putin, all the others need to be elected, can come under fire by their party, and have to calibrate every single statement with how it could be misinterpreted the least by the press. In such a confrontation, Putin looks and acts like a free citizen confronting slaves.

Likewise, it is much trustworthy to deal with the owner of a business than some employee who might be gone tomorrow. *People whose survival depends on qualitative ‘job assessments’ by someone of higher rank in an organisation cannot be trusted for critical decisions*.

The employee has a very simple objective function: fulfil his tasks or satisfy some gameable metric.

We see that with the West attitude towards Saudi Arabia. It has become clear that someone in that country is involved in the assasination of Khashoggi. However, no bureaucrat, fearful of the economic consequences made a move. You can see how, when there is no downside, governments like in the US are willing to sacrifice civilian lives to 'remove a dictator', but when there is skin in the game, they all freeze, or keep doing what they've been doing: business.

The same thing happened with the banks in 2009: the Obama administration was complicit with the Bob Rubin trade. He remove any skin in the game for bankers, thus likely reinforcing the idea that profits accrue to bankers while loses are mutualised.

Now compare these policies to ones in which decision makers have skin in the game as a substitute for their annual ‘job assessment’ and you will picture a different world.

## Chapter 4 - The skin of others in your game

Imagine working for a corporation that produces a (so far) hidden harm to the community, in concealing a property that kills thousands by an effect that is not (yet) fully visible.

You could alert the public, but you would automatically lose your job, without the certainty that a public trial may leave you humiliated for years, which is what happened to [Gilles-Éric Séralini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A9ralini_affair). Until he won his defamation suit against Monsanto, he lived in total disgrace. Oddly enough, both the [leaded gasoline]() and CFCs were both embarrasing cases in our science history invented by [Thomas Midgley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Midgley_Jr.), as brillantly explained in Bill Byrson's book [A short history of nearly everything](https://www.amazon.es/Short-History-Nearly-Everything-Bryson/dp/0552151742?SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&tag=duckduckgo-ffab-es-21&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0552151742).

In any case, as with whistleblowers, even if you end up vindicated, it may that time for the truth to emerge over the noise created by corporate shills. Meanwhile, you pay the price. You are severely conflicted between your obligation to the collective and to your progeny. You feel you are part of the crime, and unless you do something, you are an agent.

### Being ethical comes at a huge costs to others

[In the climax of 'Batman vs Superman'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDsVT7hXm54#t=1m16s), the cape crusader is about to kill Superman, whom he sees as the ultimate no-skin-in-the-game enemy, but something finally prevents him from doing it: the realisation that Superman has a mother, someone he cares for, someone for whom he would compromise his ethics.

Society likes saints and moral heroes to be celibate so they do not have family pressures that may force them into the dilemma of needing to compromise their sense of ethics to feed their children: __To make ethical choices you cannot have dilemmas between the particular (friends, family) and the general__.

That's the main driver for Venezuelan voters: [the widespread reliance on subsidies to buy groceries](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/world/americas/venezuela-election-president-maduro-food.html).

Intellectual and ethical freedom requires the absence of skin of others into one’s game, which is why the free are so rare.

### How to put skin in the game of suicide bombers

Can someone punish a family for the crimes of an individual? The scriptures are self-contradictory:

> The Lord passed by before him and proclaimed: “The Lord, the Lord, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, and abounding in loyal love and faithfulness, 7 keeping loyal love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin. But he by no means leaves the guilty unpunished, responding to the transgression of fathers by dealing with children and children’s children, to the third and fourth generation.”
>
> __Exodus 34:6-7__

> Fathers must not be put to death for what their children do, nor children for what their fathers do; each must be put to death for his own sin.
>
> __Deu 24:16__

However, the answer is clear in the case of the terrorist who thinks he is immune to harm: *You killed my family with supposed impunity; I will make yours pay some indirect price for it*.

This also applies [if you commit suicide by jumping in front of a train in Japan](https://www.economist.com/news/2009/02/06/home-again-home-again).

> Indeed, the train companies have got the business of cleaning up the mess down to a fine art, sometimes in less than 15 minutes, while commuters are handed excuse-notes to show their employers. Meanwhile, the grief of the deceased's family is heightened by having to bring a perverse kind of blood money—up to ¥3m ($34,000) as compensation to the railway company.

Have you noticed how unusual it is that Christianity, among all religions, is the only one that believes in a God that is also a man? It's not like Ancient Greek gods: the conquests of Zeus among nymphs and the mythic mortal progenitors of Hellenic dynasties are famous; nor is it buddhism, which is more a collection of traditions, beliefs and spiritual practices based on teachings attributed to the Buddha than an actual religion.

The Christian religion kept insisting on the dual nature of Jesus Christ: divine and humane. It would be theologically simpler if God were god and Jesus were man, just like any other prophet.

> The Church founders really wanted Christ to have skin in the game; he did actually suffer on the cross, sacrifice himself, and experience death.

A god who didn’t really suffer on the cross would be like a magician who performed an illusion. The human nature of Christ is what makes the divine possible for all of us.

The IYI seems ubiquitous in our lives but is a small minority, rarely seen outside specialised outlets, think tanks, media, and university. He pathologises others for doing things he doesn’t understand without even realising it is his understanding that may be limited. He thinks people should act according to their best interests and he knows their interest, particularly if they are ‘rednecks’ or from the English non-crisp-vowel class who voted Brexit.

When plebeians do something that doesn’t make sense to IYI, he uses the term ‘uneducated’. What we generally call participation in the political process, he makes the distinction between ‘populism’ when plebeians dare to vote in a way that contradicts IYI preferences, and ‘democracy’, when it fits the IYI.

## <a name="chapter7"></a>Chapter 7: Inequality and Skin in the Game

There is inequality and inequality.

The first is the one people tolerate, such as one’s understanding compared to that of people deemed heroes, like Einstein. You may like to imitate them, but you don’t resent them.

The second is the inequality people find intolerable because the subject appears to be just a person like you, except that he’s been playing the system, acquiring privileges that are not warranted. You don’t just envy them; you take umbrage at their fame, and the sight of their expensive or even semi-expensive car triggers some feeling of bitterness.

[Joan C Williams](https://hbr.org/2016/11/what-so-many-people-dont-get-about-the-u-s-working-class) explains that the American working class is impressed by the rich, as role models. Michèle Lamont, in her book [The Dignity of Working Men](https://www.amazon.com/Dignity-Working-Men-Boundaries-Immigration/dp/0674009924?SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&tag=duckduckgo-ffab-es-21&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0674009924), cited by Williams, did a systematic interview of blue-collar Americans and found resentment of high-paid professionals but, unexpectedly, not of the rich.

In countries were wealth comes from rent-seeking, political patronage or regulatory capture, like mine, wealth is seen as a zero-sum game: someone getting rich is doing so at other people’s expense. It is safe to say that the people despises people who make a lot of money on a salary.

What people resent is the person at the top who can't go down. True equality is equality in probability.

### The static and the dynamic

As part of the Scrum methodology, we have a fortnightly demo where we present what we did over the last two weeks to the rest of the company. It's common that some teams may present the number of bugs they have open, and how that number has evolved through time.

While looking at one of those charts, it kept me wondering: "what does this tell me about the time that a bug takes on average to be resolved?" And I found myself realising that it tells nothing about it: one bug may have been there for ages and no one would notice.

It certainly is funny to see that people like Piketty and other social economists don't understand this either. There is a well known economist in a well known newspaper that I read that keeps insisting that inequality has gone down, in the line drawn by Piketty and others. The real question is: __what are my prospects of a better future, or considering me as a family lineage, what are the odds of my offspring to keep on doing better?__ Those are questions that no mainstream economist is addressing.

*Static inequality is a snapshot view of inequality; it does not reflect what will happen to you in the course of your life*.

Dynamic (ergodic) inequality takes into account the entire future and past life.

Ergodic means that the likelihood to be in any economic class is the same for everyone: is the ideal concept of the American dream: for those on the top, it's a matter of someone outsmarting or outworking them to replace them.

Rawl’s veil, discussed in [Fooled by Randomness](https://www.amazon.com/Fooled-Randomness-Hidden-Markets-Incerto/dp/0812975219), assumes that a fair society is the one which you would select if there were some type of a lottery.

*What would be the economical system that you would choose, provided that you don’t know at which stage in the society are you going to fall beforehand*?

The way to make society more equal is by forcing the rich to be subjected to the risk of exiting from the 1%. Or, more mathematically, dynamic equality assumes Markov chain with no absorbing states. Someone can always bounce back from ruin, and someone can always fall back from fuck you money.

The exact opposite of perfect ergodicity is an absorbing state: a person gets rich by some process and then, having arrived, stays rich. And if someone enters the lower middle class, he will never have the chance to exit from it and become rich should he want to.

A straightforward condition is that fencing off immigrants from first class citizenship is immoral, and reduces ergodicity, because those people are unable to climb their way to the top. Nobody thinks of himself as rich, but we are, very. And there is people justified to resent us. No downside for some means no upside for the rest.

People can frame questions and portray enrichment as theft, as was done before the French Revolution, in which case the blue-collar class would ask, once again, for heads to roll, like the case with [UK Parliament expenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_parliamentary_expenses_scandal).

In the more rural past, envy was rather controlled; wealthy people were not as exposed to other persons of their class. The wealthy stayed within their region, surrounded by people who depended on them, say a lord on his properties. It was in mercantile urban environments that socialising within social classes took place. Hence, they needed to keep up with each other, racing on a treadmill. This is the time where communism is born.

For a rich person isolated from vertical socialising with the poor, the poor become something entirely theoretical, a textbook reference. That is why a politician would say 'Refugees Welcome' without thinking of the consequences of doing so: because immigrants are an abstract term to be resolved, but without my involvement.

The intelligentsia therefore feels entitled to deal with the poor as a construct; one they created. Thus, they become convinced that they know what is best for them. The reaction to 'experts' in populism is a reaction to this.

### Ethics of civil service

When, on leaving office, Barack Obama accepted a sum of more than $40 million to write his memoirs, many people were outraged. I had a rough time explaining that having rich people in a public office is very different from having public people become rich. Again, it is the dynamics that matters.

You don’t become a Jesuit priest because it may help you get hired by Goldman Sachs later.

Currently, most civil servants tend to stay in civil service— except for those in delicate areas that industry controls: the agro-alimentary segment, finance, aerospace. Regulators have an incentive to make rules as complex as possible so their expertise can later be hired at a higher price.

So there is an implicit bribe in public service, what we call [revolving doors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolving_door_(politics)). Companies don’t do it out of a sense of honour: simply, it is necessary to keep the system going and encourage the next guy to play by these rules.

## Chapter 8 - An expert called Lindy

[14 Things Ridiculously Successful People Do Every Day](https://www.entrepreneur.com/slideshow/299699), [What 12 Celebrities did to lose weight fast](http://www.nowloss.com/how-celebrities-lose-weight-fast-keep-it-off.htm), [10 of the Laziest Ways You Can Become Rich](https://www.therichest.com/rich-list/nation/10-of-the-laziest-ways-you-can-become-rich/). There are countless, clickbait-y ways to become rich, slim, and successful, and they are of course minimal changes in your life. The main idea is that "if you are not rich, slim and successful, *is because you don't want to*".

There is an industry of domain-experts telling you what you have to do. Trends, rumours, what success people do... that is nonsense. You're missing the complexities of a given person. *Having close access to ultra-successful people* cannot, in fact, yield any information. What is really going on is you're forming a theory of what people you admire do and create a narrative around that theory by using biased information. Successful philosophers write complex, long and convoluted prhases, but that doesn't mean that for you to become a successful philosopher you would have to write like that.

Who is the real expert, then? Time.

The origin of the term ‘Lindy effect’ can be traced back to Albert Goldman and a 1964 article titled ‘[Lindy’s Law](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qripnmgbnvtyx16/1964-goldman.pdf)’, and was further developed by Benoit Mandelbrot in his book [The Fractal Geometry of Nature](https://www.amazon.com/Fractal-Geometry-Nature-Benoit-Mandelbrot/dp/0716711869?SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&tag=duckduckgo-ffab-es-21&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0716711869). Mandelbrot expressed mathematically that for certain things bounded by the life of the producer, like human promise, future life expectancy is proportional to the past. It is also worth credit J Richard Gott and his ‘Copernical principle for lifetime estimation. Gott came up with the idea in 1969 when stopping at the Berlin Wall and wondering how long it would stand. He postulated that the Copernican principle is applicable in cases where nothing is known; unless there was something special about his visit, this gave a 75% chance that he was seeing the wall after the first quarter of its life.

Skin in the game is resisting the test of time. It's worth emphasising that the authors of the articles we mentioned before have, of course, no skin in the game. Change for the sake of change, as we see in architecture, food, or lifestyle, is frequently the oppose of progress. Too high a rate of mutation prevents locking in the benefits of previous changes.

### Peer review

And what is praised is suspicious: in 1983, the computer giant IBM made the front cover of BusinessWeek as the ultimate company. If anything, you should afterwards be shorting the company. Collective praise by journal is at the least, suspicious, and at best, a curse. Prizes are likely to hit you at your peak.

But there is something worse than peer assessment: the bureaucratisation of the activity creates a class of new judges: university administrators, who have no clue what someone is doing except via external signals, yet become the actual arbiters.

These arbiters failed to realise that ‘prestigious’ publications are not ‘Lindy compatible’. Academia has a tendency, when unchecked, to evolve into a ritualistic self-referential publishing game. It's the same in high school; it’s remarkable to see how the cool kids underperform everyone else afterwards.

While academia has turned into an athletic contest, Wittgenstein, the author of [Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus](https://www.amazon.com/Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus-Ludwig-Wittgenstein/dp/0486404455/ref=sr_1_1), held the exact opposite viewpoint: if anything, knowledge is the reverse of an athletic contest.

>In philosophy, the winner of the race is the one who can run slowest. [Or without haste.] Or the one who arrives at the finish line last.
>
> -- __Wittgenstein__

The most convincing statements are those in which one stands to lose, and the most unconvincing ones are those in which one patently tries to enhance one’s status without making a tangible contribution.

Someone with a high public presence who is controversial, like [Jose Mourinho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mourinho), and takes risks for his opinion is less likely to be a bullshit vendor.

### Science is Lindy-compatible

>It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with experiment, it's wrong.
>
> -- __Richard P Feynman__

The reason science works isn’t because of the ‘scientific method’, but because an idea will fail if it isn’t useful, and can therefore be vulnerable to the falsification of time. For things to survive, they necessarily have to be good at not dying.

This, as [Jordan Peterson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis) noted, also applies to superstitions that have crossed centuries because they led to some protective actions.

Whatever your grandpa or your grandma tells you, it's probably right. They rely on ancient knowledge that has survived for generations through the people that tell them. Idioms and expressions, like myths and superstitions, are the real memes.

## __Book 6 - Deeper into Agency__

## Chapter 9 - Surgeons should not look like surgeons

When I was younger, I used to play in a football team as a goalkeeper. I was 1 foot taller than the other goalkeeper, so by watching us warming up you would have thought that I was starting, and he was the substitute goalie. It was, unexpectedly, the opposite.

Say you had the choice between two surgeons of similar rank in the same department in some hospital. The first is highly refined in appearance; he is the person you would put in a movie if you need to impersonate a surgeon. The second one looks like a butcher; in a movie, you would expect him to impersonate a retired bodyguard for a junior congressman.

Now, if I had to pick, I would take the butcher any minute. The one who doesn’t look the part, conditional on having made a successful career in his profession, had to have much to overcome in terms of perception.

When results come from dealing directly with reality rather than through the agency of commentators, image matters less, even if it correlates with skills. Skilled thieves at large should not look like thieves. Those who do are more likely to be in jail.

Consider the CEOs of corporations: they don’t just look the part, they even look the same. Executives are different from entrepreneurs and are supposed to look like actors. So it becomes no wonder that the job of CEO of the country was filled by a former actor, Ronald Reagan. Actually, the best actor is the one nobody realises is an actor: a closer look at Barack Obama shows that he was even more of an actor: a fancy Ivy League education combined with a liberal reputation is compelling as an image builder.

> Don’t hire newscasters as CEOs. They seem confident, but they can only read the teleprompter.
>
> -- Paul Graham

In any type of activity or business divorced from the direct filter of skin in the game, a great majority of people know the jargon, play the part, and are intimate with the cosmetic details, but are clueless about the subject.

What one may need to know in the real world does not necessarily match what one can perceive through intellect.

> What can be phrased and expressed in a clear narrative that convinces suckers will be a sucker trap.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

The people you understand most easily were necessarily the bullshitters. I was once given the advice not to trust any technique that could be encapsulated in an acronym, like KISS, DRY, SOLID, and so on.

The illusion prevails that business work via business plans and science via funding. This is strictly not true: a business plan is a useful narrative for those who want to convince a sucker. It works because firms in the entrepreneurship business make most of their money packaging companies and selling them; it is not easy to sell without some strong narrative. For real business, something that should survive on its own, business plans and funding work backward. There are countless cases in [IndieHackers](https://indiehackers.com) about successful business that thrive without or with very little VC funding, because their main focus is on monthly revenue, not in active users.

Why is there so much complication then? It's mostly because of the reliance on experts to do the job, instead of growing the knowledge organically. If a financial firm needs, say, to 'digitise', they rely on consultants to do the job, as this is a temporal issue that needs to be dealt with experts. Thus, the decision makers hire experts, consultants, academics.

> Never hire an academic unless his function is to partake of the rituals of writing papers and taking exams.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

Likewise, you should not rely on an industry that is built on top of PowerPoint presentations (it was the core of my initial training when I joined a consultancy firm). They are likely to deal with you with unnecessary complications, as it is convey expertise.

But there is a logic behind these rituals. History shows that there were societies in which the intellectual was at the top (brahmans, druids, scribes, scholars). You can notice a remarkable similarity to the way these intellectuals held power and separated themselves from the rest: through complex, extremely elaborate rituals, mysteries that stay within the caste, and an overriding focus on the cosmetics.

No ‘successful’ academic could ever afford to follow [what Alexander the Great did with the Gordian knot](https://www.history.com/news/what-was-the-gordian-knot). It took medicine a long time to realise that when a patient shows up with a headache, it is much better to give him aspirin or recommend a good night’s sleep than do brain surgery, although the latter appears to be more ‘scientific’.

> Richard Dawkins, for example, argues that “[A baseball catcher] behaves as if he had solved a set of differential equations in predicting the trajectory of the ball. At some subconscious level, 	something functionally equivalent to the mathematical calculations is going on”.
> (…) Instead, experiments have shown that players rely on several heuristics. The gaze heuristic is the simplest one and works if the ball is already high up in the air: Fix your gaze on the ball, start running, and adjust your running speed so that the angle of gaze remains constant.
>
> -- __Gerd Gigerenzer and Henry Brigthon__, [Homo Heuristicus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3629675/)

Humans are assumed to be overly rational in their responses to all manner of natural phenomena, rather than accepting the role of a collection of mental heuristics used for specific purposes.

Likewise, many problems in society come from the interventions of people who sell complicated solutions because that’s what their position and training invite them to do.

> There has been a problem of malnutrition and nutrient deficiency in many developing countries, which (…) Yaneer Bar-Yam and Joe Norman attribute to a simple and very straightfoward transportation issue. Simply, we waste more than a third of our food supply, and the gains from simple improvement in distribution would far outweigh those from modification of supply. (…) Now the “techies” saw an angle of intervention. First, you show pictures of starving children to elicit sympathy and prevent further discussion— anyone who argues in the presence of dying children is a heartless a**hole. Second, you make it look like any critic of your method is arguing against saving the children. Third, you propose some scientific-looking technique that is lucrative to you and, should it cause a catastrophe or blight, insulates you from the long-term effects. Fourth, you enlist journalists and useful idiots (…). Fifth, you create a smear campaign to harm the reputations of researches who, not having f*** you money, are very vulnerable to the slightest blemish to their reputations.

The technique in question consists in genetically modifying rice to have the grains include vitamins. Check out Pamela Ronald's TED Talk (of course) '[The case for engineering our food](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZ2TF8-PGQ4)', with a picture of kids holding hands at [4:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZ2TF8-PGQ4#t=4m17s).

> Why don’t we give these people rice and vitamins separately? After all, we don’t have genetically modified coffee that has milk with it.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

The same happened with [Joseph Kony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4MnpzG5Sqc). The video mostly goes like this: the Earth from the outside, people hugging each other (presumably family), lots of kids, people sharing videos on Youtube (because that's how you finish world hunger), the Earth again, the video's director's wife giving birth to their kid, accompanied with endless pictures and videos of him for over 4 minutes. And then, you're introduced to Jacob, another kid, but this time in Gulu, Uganda. There is an evil man called Joseph Kony who makes him suffer and terrorises the area.

The same pattern that Taleb has displayed repeats in that video: *either you're for invading Uganda and removing the dictator Kony, or you're against the children*.

## Chapter 10 - Only rich people are poisoned; the preferences of others

If academics and consultants are incentivised to sell you complication, we are impressed by it.

Take gyms: people are impressed by expensive equipment— fancy, complicated, multicoloured. Things appear maximally sophisticated and scientific– but remember that what looks scientific is usually scientism, not science. What people into strength training already know is that users of these machines gain no strength beyond an initial phase, and that the simple barbell is the only standard piece of equipment that gets you to recruit your entire body for exercises— and the simplest and cheapest to get.

Lindy again: weightlifters have known the phenomenology for at least two and a half millennia.

So long as society is getting richer, someone will try to sell you something until the point of degradation of your well-being, and a bit beyond that. You don't really __need__ the iPhone, we have spent most of our lives without it; it's an artificial need called network effect, that comes as a result of people in our environment using it.

When people get rich, they lose control of their preferences, complicate their lives unnecessarily, trigger their own misery. And these constructed preferences are of course the preferences of those who want to sell them something. And given that they are rich, nobody would shout *victim*.

Now in this part, Taleb refers to the concept of 'Michelin-star' restaurant. If you've ever been to one, the idea revolves not in leaving you full, but in making you experience tastes that you don't normally do. Taleb doesn't see it that way.

> I once had a dinner in a Michelin-starred restaurant. [...] I left the place starving. [...] If I had a choice, I would have had some time-tested recipe. [...] But because the dinner partner could afford the expensive restaurant, we ended up victims of some complicated experiments by a chef judged by some Michelin bureaucrat. It would fail the Lindy effect: food does better through minute variations from Sicilian grandmother to Sicilian grandmother.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

I can see the point: these restaurants are trying their best to earn the approval of that 'Michelin bureaucrat', instead of the customer; incentives are perverse. And indeed, given the importance of keeping up with a balanced diet, not with working out to offset the effects of a bad one, we cannot be surprise to learn that [for the first time in the history of the world more people will die from overeating than undereating this year](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/fact-check-bloomberg-claims-more-people-die-of-obesity-than-hunger). There are conflicting studies for and against this claim, but it's worth notice the irony of people dying of eating too much, and people eating too litte at the same time in history.

So why target rich people with overly complicated food that doesn't feed?

As Thyestes shouts in Seneca’s tragedy, thieves do not enter impecunious homes. Poison is drunk in golden cups (*Venenum in auro bibitur*).

It is easy to scam rich people by getting them into complications— the poor are spared that type of scamming. Further, the rich start using ‘experts’ and ‘consultants’.

> An entire industry meant to swindle you will swindle you: financial consultants, diet advisors, exercise experts, lifestyle engineers, sleeping councillors, breathing specialists, etc.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

Same with real state: when people have big bucks they end up pressured to move into outsized, impersonal, and silent mansions. Very few people understand their own choices, and end up being manipulated by those who want to sell them something.

If wealth is giving you fewer options instead of more, you are doing it wrong.

And closing the circle here, we talked in [Chapter 1](#chapter1) about
how “Me” is more likely to be a group than a single person. This applies here again.

## Chapter 11 - Facta non Verba (deeds before words)

There are two totally distinct varieties of terrorists.

The first group includes non soldiers who indiscriminately kill civilians for effect and don’t bother with military targets, as their aim is to make a statement: Al Qaeda, ISIS, and the ‘moderate’ rebels in Syria sponsored by the EU and by former US president Obama.

The second group is about strategic political assassination: IRA, most Shiite organisations, Algerian independence fighters against France, French resistance fighters during the German occupation, etc.

The latter are inspired by the order of the Assassins.

### The Assasins

The best enemy is one you own by putting skin in his game and letting him know the exact rules that come with it. You keep him alive, with the knowledge that he owes his life to your benevolence.

The notion that an enemy you own is better than a dead one was perfected by the order of [the Assassins]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassins). Formally known as Nizari Ismailis, they were an eleventh- through fourteenth-century sect related to Shiite Islam, often associated with the Knights Templar as they fought frequently on the same side. The most interesting thing about The Assassins is that actual assassination was low in their agenda. They understood that the only enemy you cannot manipulate is a dead one.

The ethical system of the Assassins held that political assassination helped prevent war. They supposedly aimed at sparing civilians and people who were not directly targeted. Their precision was meant to reduce what is now called ‘collateral damage’.

In fact, what the paper by Taleb and Cirillo that we spoke of in [Chapter 7](#chapter7) also discovered was that *that the number of casualties and armies have been historically inflated by both sides*. Both the armies and their panicky victims had an incentive to exaggerate, which acted as a deterrent.

When Pinker sees that violence has decreased throughout history, he can't see that war is more violent, but less frequent. And considering the inflated numbers in history, casualties may have even gone higher.

> Why should we be content with only a relative decrease? By this logic, when we reach a world population of nine billion in 2050, Pinker [on ‘The Better Angels of our Nature] will conceivably be satisfied if a mere two million people are killed in war that year

### The camera for skin in the game

Thanks to the camera, you no longer need to put horses’ heads in boutique hotels. Today, [anonymity brings out the asshole in people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_disinhibition_effect).

But just the act of taking their pictures is similar to holding their lives in your hands and controlling their future behaviour thanks to your silence. [That's why companies like Facebook and Google are so potentially dangerous to society](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084953/).

Today, strangers, incapable of judging a person’s general character, have become self-appointed behaviour police. Web-shaming is much more powerful than past reputational blots, and more of a tail risk.

That, again, isn't something we've just discovered. In Book 2 of Plato’s [Republic](https://www.amazon.com/Republic-AmazonClassics-Plato/dp/1542048664), there is a discussion between Socrates and Plato’s bother, Glaucon, about the ring of Gyges, which gives its holder the power to be invisible at will and watch others. This is the same story that H. G. Wells’ ‘The Invisible Man’ has as its basis, the ring that inspired the Alberich’s Ring in Richard Wagner’s ’The Ring of the Nibelung’, and, of course, the One Ring from J. R. R. Tolkien’s ‘The Hobbit’ and ‘The Lord of the Rings’.

>__Glaucon__: "Suppose now that there were two such magic rings, and the just put on one of them and the unjust the other[...]. No man would keep his hands off what was not his own when he could safely take what he liked out of the market [...], in all respects be like a god among men.
>
>Then the actions of the just would be as the actions of the unjust; they would both come at last to the same point. And this we may truly affirm to be a great proof that a man is just, not willingly or because he thinks that justice is any good to him individually, but of necessity, for wherever any one thinks that he can safely be unjust, there he is unjust.
> For all men believe in their hearts that injustice is far more profitable to the individual than justice, and he who argues as I have been supposing, will say that they are right. If you could imagine any one obtaining this power of becoming invisible, and never doing any wrong or touching what was another's, he would be thought by the lookers-on to be a most wretched idiot, although they would praise him to one another's faces, and keep up appearances with one another from a fear that they too might suffer injustice."

Ah, but that's exactly the kind informal survey that, back in 2001, a young John Hodgman conducted and asked [in an episode of This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/178/superpowers/act-one-0).

Socrates, by the way, disagreed with Glaucon. He argued that you should only do what's right—irrespective of matters of life or death. And he didn't just gave that as an advice: [he lost his life because of it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates#Trial_and_death).

## Chapter 12 - The Facts are True, the News is Fake

> In the summer of 2009, I partook an hour-long public discussion with David Cameron, (Note: see here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQAVDg4yqUU). It turned out that I presented my version of the precautionary principle during the conversation, where one does not need complex models as a justification to avoid a certain action. Models are error prone, and most risks only appear in analyses after harm is done, that’s why if we don’t understand something and it has a systemic effect, just avoid it. Like with climate change, the burden is on those who pollute to show a lack of tail risk.

Journalism isn’t Lindy compatible. Historically, dissemination of news took place in pubs, funerals, marketplaces, when going to the barber shop, etc. Unreliable people carried less weight than reliable ones. You can’t fool people more than twice.

As Dan Carlin noted in ['Hardcore History'](https://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-56-kings-of-kings/), the Persian empire was built around the idea that lying was the worst crime.

Briefly, from the middle of the twentieth century until the US election of 2016, we relied on one-sided accounts such as TV and newspapers. This ended effectively when Donald Trump was elected president, and probably earlier. At that point, social networks, allowing a two way information, returned the mechanisms of tides to its natural format: Lindy had to strike.

Further, such an agency problem as that of the current press is systemic, as its interests will keep diverging from that of its public until the eventual blowup as with any Bob Rubin trade.

This is the future of journalism: None. Like blockchain, social media has solved the problem with network reliability; confiding on a reduced number of trusted sources is problematic, as tunnelling information is prone to manipulation, in the same way that an accountant would have an incentive to crook the books when no one is watching.

> You never cure structural defects; the system corrects itself by collapsing. One way journalism will self-destruct from its growing divergence from the public is illustrated by the Gawker story. Gawker was a voyeurism outfit that specialised in publicising people’s private lives in industrial proportions, like any given tabloid. Eventually Gawker, which bullied its financially weaker victims (often 21-year-olds in revenge porn scenes), got bullied by someone richer and went bankrupt. Journalism sided with Gawker on grounds of ‘freedom of information’, which serves as a reminder that journalism is the mother of all agency problems.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

The divergence is obvious in that journey worry considerably more about the opinion of other journalists than the judgment of their readers. There are endless accounts of journalists who claim not to pay attention to comments on their articles, and second, their Twitter feeds consist mostly in interactions with other journalists.

Economic insecurity worsens the condition. We can safely assume that no news agency in Spain is profitable; [CNN Spain closed in December 2010 and was immediately replaced with 24-hour coverage of the Spanish version of the reality show Big Brother].

> Journalists are currently in the most insecure profession you can find: ostracism by their friends would be terminal. You say something unpopular in that profession about Brexit, GMOs, Putin, and you become history. This is the opposite of business, where conforming to the group is penalised.

### The ethics of disagreement


As we discussed in [How to Read a Book](/2018/10/how-to-read-a-book), you can criticise either what a person said or what a person meant. The mark of a charlatan is to defend his position or attack a critic by focusing on the former, for focusing on the latter requires an extensive grasp of the proposed idea.

It is impossible to write a perfectly rationally argued document without a tiny segment that can be decontextualised to appear totally absurd and lend itself to sensationalisation, so politicians, charlatans and, more disturbingly, journalists hunt for these segments. Most cartoonists make fun of Trump without realising that they are focusing on the words rather than what he means, which is what their supporters grasp.

## Chapter 13 - The Merchandising of Virtue

Lycurgus, the Spartan lawmaker, responded to a suggestion to allow democracy there, saying ‘begin with your own family”.

It is immoral to claim virtue without fully living with its direct consequences.

Likewise, if you believe that you are ‘helping the poor’ by spending money on PowerPoint presentations and International meetings, the type of meetings that lead to more meetings, the poor become an abstract reified construct that you do not encounter in your real life.

At some point in history, if you had money, you could part with some of it to exonerate your sins. Simony was a convenient way for the church to raise funds, and the same with indulgences: the buyer had an inexpensive option on paradise, the seller was selling something that costs nothing, what traders would call ‘free money’.

Indulgences were not markedly different from the pagan practice of giving offerings to propitiate the gods. Offerings are placed in Indonesia at the entrance to homes, at family and main temples, before and on statues, even at corners of intersections to ward off accidents and aid in protection. The offerings are then left untouched and allowed to be destroyed by the elements and animal kingdom.

Now consider publicly giving a million dollars to some ‘charity’. Part of that money will be spent to advertise that you are giving money. *Do you see any difference between this and indulgences?*

From the scaling property, we can safely establish that __virtue is doing something for the collective, particularly when such an action conflicts with your narrowly defined interests__.

One of the problems of the interventionist results in disrupting some of the peace making mechanisms that are inherent in human affairs.

History is largely peace punctuated by wars. The problem is that we humans are prone to the availability heuristic, by which the salient is mistaken for the statistical.

> -— __Charles Stewart__

The main idea in [How to Read a Book](/2018/10/how-to-read-a-book) was that two people can be using the same word, meaning different things, yet continue the conversation. That's fine for coffee, but not when making decisions.

Different people rarely mean the same thing when they say ‘religion’. For early Jews and Muslims, religion was *law*. For early Jews, it was *tribal*, whereas for early Muslims, it was *universal*; for the Romans, it was *social events, rituals, festivals* (counter to superstitio). Early Christianity stayed relatively away from the law (in Christian Aramaic it uses din for religion and nomous for law). Neither Islam nor Judaism have a marked separation between holy and profane, and that is why the state of Israel exists, and many Arab countries are ruled by Sharia Law.

For most Jews today, religion has become *ethnocultural*. For Orthodox and Catholic Christians, religion is largely *aesthetics*. For Buddhists, Shintoists, and Hindus, religion is *practical and spiritual philosophy*, with a code of ethics (and even a cosmogony). In Serbia, Croatia and Lebanon, religion means one thing at times of peace, and something quite different at times of war.

There is a crucial distinction between The Bible, which isn’t believed to be literally God speaking, but a product of divine inspiration; and the Quran, believed to have been verbally revealed by God to the final Prophet Muhammad through the archangel Gabriel. Even the musical comedy ‘[The Book of Mormon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Mormon_(musical))’ is driven by this problem, say, the functional belief of religion versus the literal interpretation of the story of Joseph Smith's founding of the Mormon community.

"That is not what happened" is a crucial statement in religion. The world may have not been created in 7 days, but the stories about the Eden, Cain and Abel, Noah, etc... are the stories that encapsulate a way of behaving in the world that helped Judaism survive throughout centuries.

Some beliefs are, hence, decorative, others are functional (they help with survival) and others are literal. Religions such as Christianity, Judaism, and to some extent Shiite Islam evolved precisely by moving away from the literal: it doesn’t leave any room for adaptation.

## Chapter 16 - No worship without skin in the game

It is when you break a fast that you understand religion. The main theological flaw in Pascal’s wager, which stipulates that believing in the creator has a positive payoff in case he truly exists, and no downside in case he doesn’t, is that belief cannot be a free option. It entails a symmetry between what you pay and what you receive.

The altar in [Saint Sergius](https://www.saintsergius.org/) has a drain for blood. It had been recycled from an earlier pre-Christian practice: early Christians were sort of pagans, and in practice were not too differentiated from other Semitic cult followers, and shared places of worship with one another.

The presence of saints in Christianity comes from that mechanism of recycling, as explained in detail in [Pagan Christianity](https://www.amazon.com/Pagan-Christianity-Exploring-Church-Practices/dp/1414364555). Christianity ended up removing the idea that such sacrifices under the notion that Christ sacrifice himself for others. However, if you happen to go to mass on Sunday, you’ll see wine representing blood, closely resembling the altar in Saint Sergius. Sacrifice was ended by making it metaphorical.

## Chapter 17 - Is the Pope Atheist?

After Pope John Paul II was shot in 1981, he was rushed to the emergency room. At no point during the emergency period did the drivers of the ambulance consider taking the pope to a chapel for a prayer.

This is not to say that bishops, cardinals, priests, and mere laypeople didn’t pray; but it remains that nobody in the Vatican seems to ever take chances by going first to the Lord, and nobody seems to see a conflict with such inversion of the logical sequence.

Now try to imagine a powerful head of an ‘atheist’ sect equivalent to the Pope, suffering a similar health exigency. His actions would have been identical. Clearly, there are lots of differences between the Pope and an atheist of equivalent rank, but these concerns matter that are not life-threatening.

There was a period, the Albigensian crusade, during which Catholics engaged in the mass killing of heretics. Some slaughtered indiscriminately, heretics and non heretics, as a time saver and since “Lord would be able to tell them apart”.

Those times are long gone: nowadays, most Christians, when it comes to central medical, ethical, and decision-making situations, do not act differently than atheists.

So we define atheism or secularism in deeds, by the distance between one’s actions and those of a nonathestic person for an equivalent situation, not his beliefs and other decorative and symbolic matters, which do not count.

## __Book 8 - Rationality and Risk Taking__

## Chapter 18 - How to be rational about rationality

When we look at religion, we should consider what purpose they serve, rather than focusing on the notion of ‘belief’. In real life, belief is an instrument to do things, not the end product.

This is similar to vision: the purpose of your eyes is to orient you in the best possible way, not sensors designed just to capture the electromagnetic spectrum. Their job description is not to produce accurate scientific representations, but rather the most useful ones.

The same applies to distortion of beliefs.

Survival comes first; truth, understanding, and science latter.

> To make money, you must first survive

> --__Warren Buffet__

Those who take risks have their priorities firmer than vague textbook pseudo-rationalism.

### From Simon to Gigerenzer

Herb Simon formulated the notion of bounded rationality: __we cannot possibly measure and assess everything as if we were a computer__; we therefore have, under evolutionary pressures, some shortcuts and distortions to avoid getting into unanticipated trouble.

A fertile research program on ecological rationality, led by Gerd Gigerenzer, mapped how many things that do that appear, on the surface, illogical, but have deeper reasons.

### Revelation of preferences

Ken Binmore showed that the concept casually dubbed ‘rational’ is ill-defined. Everything lies in the notion of ‘revealed prefences’: __you will only have an idea about what people really think by looking at what they pay for goods, not by asking them__. This is a reformulation of skin in the game.

### What is religion about?

> It is therefore my opinion that religion exists to enforce tail risk management across generations, as its binary and unconditional rules are easy to teach and enforce.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

Superstitions can be vectors for risk-management rules. We have as potent information that people who have them have survived. Much of what we call ‘belief’ is some kind of background furniture for the human mind that, according to Jung, is ingrained in our psyche as part of adapting ourselves as an species to coexisting with ourselves.

How much you truly ‘believe’ in something can be manifested only through what you are willing to risk for it.

The classical sophrosyne means precaution, self-control, and temperance all in one. ‘Rationality’ was forged during the Enlightenment era, at a time when we thought that understanding the world was around the corner.

__What is rational is that which allows for survival__. Anything that hinders one’s survival is irrational, at an individual, collective, tribal, or general level.

When you consider beliefs in evolutionary terms, do not look at how they compete with each other, but consider the survival of the populations who have them.

Think, for instance, the reverence for cows in India. You would've thought that it is irrational to have such respect for what's just an animal, but the reality is hidden in plain sight: in rural India, cows are the main power source to plow the fields, it weeds them out, and it fertilises them. Eating the cow's meat may be OK in the short-term, but those who did so couldn't survive longer. Thus, what remains is that [Article 48 of the Constitution of India](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1452355/) prescribes the state to prohibit the slaughter of cows and calves and other milch and draught cattle.

## Chapter 19 - The logic of risk taking

Consider the following thought experiment.

First case, one hundred people go to a casino to gamble a certain set of amount each over a period of time. Some may lose, some may win, and we can infer when the time’s up what the ‘edge’ is by counting the money left in the wallets of the people who return. Now assume gambler number 28 goes bust. Does that affect gambler 29? Of course not.

Second case, one person, your cousin Theodorus Ibn Warqa, goes to the casino a hundred days in a row, starting with a set amount. On day 28, cousin Theodorus Ibn Warqa goes bust. Will there be a day 29? Of course not.

You can safely assume that he has a 100% chance of eventually going bust.

The probabilities of success from a collection of people do not apply to cousin Theodorus. The first is what we call ensemble probability, and the second one time probability.

> When you read material by finance professors based on the long-term returns of the market, beware: No individual can get the same returns as the market unless he has infinite pockets and no uncle points. This is conflating ensemble with time probability.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

Sequence matters: the presence of ruin disqualifies cost-benefit analyses.

Out of nowhere came [a paper by Ole Peters and Murray Gell-Mann](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.4940236) where they presented a version of the difference between ensemble and time probabilities and showed that just about everything in social sincere having to do with probability is deeply flawed.

How come nobody for 250 years quite got it? Lack of skin in the game, obviously.

Let’s call these situations that prevents people with skin in the game from emerging from it *ruin*, as there is no reversibility away from that condition. __If there is a possibility of ruin, no matter how small, cost-benefit analyses are no longer possible__.

> Consider a more extreme example: let’s play Russian roulette. A collection of people may play it for a million dollars once, making money about 5 in 6 of them. If someone uses a standard cost-benefit analysis, he would have claimed that one has an average return per shot of $833,333. But if it’s just you playing again and again, your expected return is... not computable.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

Let’s see why statistical testing and scientific are highly insufficient in the presence of ruin and repetition of exposures. If one claims that there is a statistical evidence that a plane is safe with a 98% confidence level, it pretty much means that you’re unlikely to reach your 100th flight, which at 10 or 15 flights per week means you’re done in a couple of months: practically no experienced pilot would be alive today.

Psychologists like Kahnemann and Tversky determine our ‘paranoia’ or ‘risk aversion’ by subjecting a person to a single experiment— then declare that humans are rationally challenged as there is an innate tendency to ‘overestimate’ small probabilities.

Let's put that idea to a test: smoking a single cigarette is extremely benign, so a cost-benefit analysis would deem it irrational to give up so much pleasure for so little risk. Of course, it’s the act of smoking that kills, at a certain number of packs per year, in other words, __repeated exposure__.

In real life, every single bit of risk you take adds up to reduce your life expectancy, although no single action will have a meaningful effect. It’s like multiplying your 100% ideal case by 99.99% again and again, meaning exposing yourself once to an event of ruin with chances 1,000:1 in your favour. 10 times, 100 times, even 1,000 subsequent attempts aren’t distinguishable from being safe; it’s when you get to the 10,000 times (you’re down to 90%) and 100,000 (down to 37%) that you can see clearly the trouble you’re in. This idea of repetition makes paranoia about some low-probability events, even that deemed pathological, perfectly rational.

Further, there is a twist. If medicine is progressively improving your life expectancy, you need to be even more paranoid. Confusion arises because it may seem that if the ‘one-off’ risk is reasonable, then an additional one is also reasonable. This can be quantified by recognising that the probability of ruin approaches 1 as the number of exposures to individually small risks increases.

>The flaw in psychology papers is to believe that the subject doesn’t take any other tail risks anywhere outside the experiment and, crucially, will never again take any risk at all.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

Ruin is indivisible and invariant to the source of randomness that may cause it.

Another common error in the psychology literature concerns what is called ‘mental accounting’, the tendency of people to mentally put their funds in separate insulated accounts, focusing on the source of the money. For an investment strategy to be ergodic and eventually capture the return of the market, agents increase their risks as they are winning, but contract after losses, a technique called ‘*playing with the house money*’. This method is practiced by probably every single trader that has ever survived.

Now it happens that this dynamic strategy is deemed out of line by behavioural financers like Thaler, who call this a mistake.

> I believe that risk aversion does not exist: what we observe is, simply, a residual of ergodicity. People are trying to avoid financial suicide and take a certain attitude to tail risks.

### Who is ‘you’?

One of the defects modern education introduces is the illusion that each one of us is a single unit.

Unless you are perfectly narcissist and psychopathic, your worst case scenario is never limited to the loss of only your life. Thus, individual ruin is not as big a deal as collective ruin.

> The fragility of the system’s components (provided they are renewable and replaceable) is required to ensure the solidity of the system as a whole. If humans were immortals, they would have gone extinct from an accident, or from a gradual buildup of mistiness. Shorter shelf life for humans allows genetic changes across generations to be in sync with the variability of the environment.

> -- __Skin in the Game__

The virtue is, then, courage, understood as sacrificing your own well-being for the sake of the survival of a layer higher than yours. A foolish gambler is not committing an act of courage, especially if he is risking other people’s funds or has a family to feed.

If superstition is what’s needed to satisfy ergodicity, so be it. Warren Buffett did not make his billions by cost-benefit analysis; rather, he established a high filter, then picked opportunities that pass such a threshold.  Likewise, our wiring might be adapted to ‘say no’ to tail risk. It doesn’t cost me much to go with my ‘refined paranoia’, even if wrong. For all it takes is for my paranoia to be right once, and it saves my life.

However, scale is everything: jumping from a bench would be good for you and your bones, while failing from the twenty-second floor will never be so. Fearmonering about some classes of events is fear mongering, about others is not.

All risks are not equal. We often hear that ‘ebola is causing fewer deaths than people drowning in their bathtubs’.

> Mediocristan risks are always subjected to the Chernoff bound.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

That is, the probability that the number of people who drown in their bathtubs in the US doubles next year is virtually zero. This cannot be said about the doubling of the number of people being killed by terrrorists over the same period.

In a strategy that entails ruin, benefits never offset risks of ruin. Rationality is avoidance of systemic ruin.
