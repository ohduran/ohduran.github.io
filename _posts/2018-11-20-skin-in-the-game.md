Knowledge can mean different things to different people. For taxi drivers in London, ['The Knowledge'](https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/taxis-and-private-hire/licensing/learn-the-knowledge-of-london) is the exam that candidates must pass before sitting behind the wheel of one of the famous black cabs and drive quickly through London's complicated road network. It typically takes three to four years, and those who pass it have an encyclopedic knowledge of the streets and places of interest.

Then, in 2005, Google Maps was invented. The question is: 'Is still worth it to pass The Knowledge?'

Consider the following thought experiment: a naive tourist who have never been to London jumps into a cab, and asks for directions to, say, the London Eye. You, an experienced taxi driver, know your ways into the City, but more importantly, have the upper hand: his final destination is only 5 minutes away. Do you take the oblivious tourist there by the longest and most expensive route?

Well, it's risky. It can go well, and you'll earn an extra £20, perhaps £50... provided that you don't get caught. Because if you do get caught, fire rains upon you: you lose your license, and with it, 4 years of your life learning the intricacies of the London tracks goes to waste.

Now let's do the same thing if you are armed with your brand new smartphone, which has Google Maps on it, and you're good to go as a newly hired Uber driver. Same story again, same naive tourist, same silly route that can be diverted into an extra bonus. Do you fall for it?

Of course you do. In the second case, you don't have __skin in the game__.

> Skin in the game is necessary to understand the world. Do not understand it as ‘incentives’, as it is understood in finance. It is about symmetry, like having a share of the harm, paying a penalty if something goes wrong. Having an exposure to the real world, and paying a price for its consequences, good or bad.

The book we are covering today is [Skin in the Game](https://www.amazon.com/Skin-Game-Hidden-Asymmetries-Daily/dp/042528462X), by Nassim Taleb. It's the last book of a collection called *Incerto*, an investigation of opacity, luck, uncertainty, probability, human error, risk, and decision making when you don't understand the world. If this is the first time yo stumble upon Taleb, he is definitely a unique writer, and perhaps is this book, the latest one in the series, the best gateway to the rest of the Incerto books, as it covers and summarises information from the others, leaving going more deeply into any topic as an exercise to the reader. As with any good reading, the author is going down the rabbit hole along with you, and Skin in the Game is, to me, the culmination of a journey that for Taleb started in 2001 with the publication of [Fooled by Randomness](https://www.amazon.com/Fooled-Randomness-Hidden-Markets-Incerto/dp/0812975219).

> To figure out why ethics, moral obligation, and skill cannot be easily separable in real life, consider the following. When you tell someone in a position of responsibility, say your bookkeeper, "I trust you", do you mean that 1) you trust his ethics (he will not divert money to Panama), 2) you trust his accounting precision, or 3) both?

First, skin in the game is bullshit identification and filtering: *In academia there is no difference between academia and the real world; in the real world, there is*.

Second, if you have the rewards, you must also get some of the risks, not let others pay the price of your mistakes. If you inflict risk on others, and they are harmed, you need to pay some price for it: *Don’t tell me what you ‘think’, tell me what’s in your portfolio*.

Third, the book is about how much information one should practically share with others.

Fourth, it is about rationality and the test of time, as in acknowledging the complexity of our world not through models, but through trial and error.

## Book 1 - Introduction

### The interventionistas

__You cannot separate knowledge from contact with the ground__, it's what the Greeks called *pathemata mathemata* (“guide your learning through pain”). However, our world is ruled by a class of people, the *interventionistas*, who rely on models to represent reality and have forgotten that __the map isn't the territory__, the idea coined by Afred Korzybski that encapsulates that the description of the thing is not the thing itself, that the model isn't the reality, and that the abstraction is not the concrete.

> A collection of people classified as interventionistas who promoted the Iraq invasion of 2003, as well as the removal of [Ghadaffi] are advocating the imposition of additional such regime change on another batch of countries, which includes Syria, because it has a “dictator”. [...] These interventionistas and their friends helped create, train, and support Islamist rebels, “moderates”, who evolved to become part of al-Qaeda, responsible for the attack on the Twin Towers of September 11, 2001.

As explained in Christopher Phillips’ [The Battle for Syria](https://www.amazon.com/Battle-Syria-International-Rivalry-Middle/dp/030021717X), much of this foreign interference has in fact prolonged the war instead of helping win or shorten it. In the book, Phillips also gives a very good analysis of the Islamic State, noting that IS had ‘many parents’, and that if the Assad regime bore responsibility for it, so did his many international enemies, including Western countries, Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and others, who on earlier occasions supported trends which led to that movement. The story of [Barry Seal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Seal) is a testimony of the lack of scrupulousness of the US government when dealing with international affairs. It's a behaviour that you would never see in a doctor.

Interventionistas not only lack practical sense, and never learn from history, but they even fail at pure reasoning, which they drown in elaborate semiabstract buzzword-laden discourse.

Their three flaws:
1. __They think in statics, not dynamics__:

They are incapable of thinking in second steps and unaware of the need for them.

2. __They think in low, not high, dimensions__:

They can’t get the idea that, empirically, complex systems do not have obvious one-dimensional cause-and-effect mechanisms, and that under opacity, you do not mess with such a system.

3. __They think in terms of actions, never interactions__:
They can’t forecast the evolution of those one helps by attacking, or the magnification one gets from feedback.

In that sense, they aren't that far from the 'populism' that they so vigorously criticise: its solutions resemble the mainstream handling of complex issues, and it's winning not because of a renewed approach to those issues, but because the angle, the narrative is completely brand new, removing any guilt from the people who relied on mainstream politics to solve these problems in the first place.

> We end up populating what the call ‘the intelligentsia’ with people who are delusional, literally mentally deranged, simply because they never have to pay for the consequences of their actions, repeating modernist slogans stripped of all depth, like “democracy”, while encouraging headcutters.

The principle should be *do not harm*, not talking about [actions that would be designed to be limited in duration and scope](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/31/barack-obama-statement-us-intervention-syria). Those who don’t take risks should never be involved in making decisions, especially when we are now skilled enough to kill ourselves as a species.

It is, indeed, drawn a comparison between those interventionistas and bureaucrats. Bureaucracy is a construction by which a person is conveniently separated from the consequences of his or her actions. They love formulas because it prevents them from having to exercise judgment for which they might be blamed.

### Bob Rubin trade

When Taleb wrote [The Black Swan](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness-Fragility/dp/081297381X), he probably didn't expect the repercusion it got, but he definitely wouldn't have thought that people who read it and were in a position of power didn't understand it, especially if that includes the former Secretary of the Treasury, Robert Rubin.

> Bob Rubin, [...] one of those who sign their names on the banknote you just used to pay for coffee, collected more than $120 million in compensation from Citibank in the decade preceding the banking crash of 2008. When the bank, literally insolvent, was rescued by the taxpayer, he didn't write any check— he invoked uncertainty as an excuse. Heads he wins, tails he shouts "Black Swan"
