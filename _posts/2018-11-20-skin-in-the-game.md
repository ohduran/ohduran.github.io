Knowledge can mean different things to different people. For taxi drivers in London, ['The Knowledge'](https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/taxis-and-private-hire/licensing/learn-the-knowledge-of-london) is the exam that candidates must pass before sitting behind the wheel of one of the famous black cabs and drive quickly through London's complicated road network. It typically takes three to four years, and those who pass it have an encyclopedic knowledge of the streets and places of interest.

Then, in 2005, Google Maps was invented. The question is: 'Is still worth it to pass The Knowledge?'

Consider the following thought experiment: a naive tourist who have never been to London jumps into a cab, and asks for directions to, say, the London Eye. You, an experienced taxi driver, know your ways into the City, but more importantly, have the upper hand: his final destination is only 5 minutes away. Do you take the oblivious tourist there by the longest and most expensive route?

Well, it's risky. It can go well, and you'll earn an extra £20, perhaps £50... provided that you don't get caught. Because if you do get caught, fire rains upon you: you lose your license, and with it, 4 years of your life learning the intricacies of the London tracks goes to waste.

Now let's do the same thing if you are armed with your brand new smartphone, which has Google Maps on it, and you're good to go as a newly hired Uber driver. Same story again, same naive tourist, same silly route that can be diverted into an extra bonus. Do you fall for it?

Of course you do. In the second case, you don't have __skin in the game__.

> Skin in the game is necessary to understand the world. Do not understand it as ‘incentives’, as it is understood in finance. It is about symmetry, like having a share of the harm, paying a penalty if something goes wrong. Having an exposure to the real world, and paying a price for its consequences, good or bad.

The book we are covering today is [Skin in the Game](https://www.amazon.com/Skin-Game-Hidden-Asymmetries-Daily/dp/042528462X), by Nassim Taleb. It's the last book of a collection called *Incerto*, an investigation of opacity, luck, uncertainty, probability, human error, risk, and decision making when you don't understand the world. If this is the first time yo stumble upon Taleb, he is definitely a unique writer, and perhaps is this book, the latest one in the series, the best gateway to the rest of the Incerto books, as it covers and summarises information from the others, leaving going more deeply into any topic as an exercise to the reader. As with any good reading, the author is going down the rabbit hole along with you, and Skin in the Game is, to me, the culmination of a journey that for Taleb started in 2001 with the publication of [Fooled by Randomness](https://www.amazon.com/Fooled-Randomness-Hidden-Markets-Incerto/dp/0812975219).

> To figure out why ethics, moral obligation, and skill cannot be easily separable in real life, consider the following. When you tell someone in a position of responsibility, say your bookkeeper, "I trust you", do you mean that 1) you trust his ethics (he will not divert money to Panama), 2) you trust his accounting precision, or 3) both?

First, skin in the game is bullshit identification and filtering: *In academia there is no difference between academia and the real world; in the real world, there is*.

Second, if you have the rewards, you must also get some of the risks, not let others pay the price of your mistakes. If you inflict risk on others, and they are harmed, you need to pay some price for it: *Don’t tell me what you ‘think’, tell me what’s in your portfolio*.

Third, the book is about how much information one should practically share with others.

Fourth, it is about rationality and the test of time, as in acknowledging the complexity of our world not through models, but through trial and error.

## Book 1 - Introduction

### The interventionistas

__You cannot separate knowledge from contact with the ground__, it's what the Greeks called *pathemata mathemata* (“guide your learning through pain”). However, our world is ruled by a class of people, the *interventionistas*, who rely on models to represent reality and have forgotten that __the map isn't the territory__, the idea coined by Afred Korzybski that encapsulates that the description of the thing is not the thing itself, that the model isn't the reality, and that the abstraction is not the concrete.

> A collection of people classified as interventionistas who promoted the Iraq invasion of 2003, as well as the removal of [Ghadaffi] are advocating the imposition of additional such regime change on another batch of countries, which includes Syria, because it has a “dictator”. [...] These interventionistas and their friends helped create, train, and support Islamist rebels, “moderates”, who evolved to become part of al-Qaeda, responsible for the attack on the Twin Towers of September 11, 2001.

As explained in Christopher Phillips’ [The Battle for Syria](https://www.amazon.com/Battle-Syria-International-Rivalry-Middle/dp/030021717X), much of this foreign interference has in fact prolonged the war instead of helping win or shorten it. In the book, Phillips also gives a very good analysis of the Islamic State, noting that IS had ‘many parents’, and that if the Assad regime bore responsibility for it, so did his many international enemies, including Western countries, Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and others, who on earlier occasions supported trends which led to that movement. The story of [Barry Seal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Seal) is a testimony of the lack of scrupulousness of the US government when dealing with international affairs. It's a behaviour that you would never see in a doctor.

Interventionistas not only lack practical sense, and never learn from history, but they even fail at pure reasoning, which they drown in elaborate semiabstract buzzword-laden discourse.

Their three flaws:
1. __They think in statics, not dynamics__:

They are incapable of thinking in second steps and unaware of the need for them.

2. __They think in low, not high, dimensions__:

They can’t get the idea that, empirically, complex systems do not have obvious one-dimensional cause-and-effect mechanisms, and that under opacity, you do not mess with such a system.

3. __They think in terms of actions, never interactions__:
They can’t forecast the evolution of those one helps by attacking, or the magnification one gets from feedback.

In that sense, they aren't that far from the 'populism' that they so vigorously criticise: its solutions resemble the mainstream handling of complex issues, and it's winning not because of a renewed approach to those issues, but because the angle, the narrative is completely brand new, removing any guilt from the people who relied on mainstream politics to solve these problems in the first place.

> We end up populating what the call ‘the intelligentsia’ with people who are delusional, literally mentally deranged, simply because they never have to pay for the consequences of their actions, repeating modernist slogans stripped of all depth, like “democracy”, while encouraging headcutters.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

The principle should be *do not harm*, not talking about [actions that would be designed to be limited in duration and scope](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/31/barack-obama-statement-us-intervention-syria). Those who don’t take risks should never be involved in making decisions, especially when we are now skilled enough to kill ourselves as a species.

It is, indeed, drawn a comparison between those interventionistas and bureaucrats. Bureaucracy is a construction by which a person is conveniently separated from the consequences of his or her actions. They love formulas because it prevents them from having to exercise judgment for which they might be blamed.

### Bob Rubin trade

When Taleb wrote [The Black Swan](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness-Fragility/dp/081297381X), he probably didn't expect the repercusion it got, but he definitely wouldn't have thought that people who read it and were in a position of power didn't understand it, especially if that includes the former Secretary of the Treasury, Robert Rubin.

> Bob Rubin, [...] one of those who sign their names on the banknote you just used to pay for coffee, collected more than $120 million in compensation from Citibank in the decade preceding the banking crash of 2008. When the bank, literally insolvent, was rescued by the taxpayer, he didn't write any check— he invoked uncertainty as an excuse. Heads he wins, tails he shouts "Black Swan"

The book [Other People's Money](https://www.amazon.com/Other-Peoples-Money-Business-Finance/dp/1610397150) talks about this problem in more depth, and the concept of *clawback* bonuses, that is, taking it back, possibly with an added penalty, in the event that something that results of their actions ends up badly.

This is the main consequence of bailouts: government interference in general tends to remove skin in the game. The same happened in financial markets: the risk taking business started moving toward small independent structures known as hedge funds, mostly because of the overbureaucratization of the system as paper shufflers overburdened the banks with [rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_III), but avoided considering skin in the game. In the decentralised hedge fund space, on the other hand, owner-operators have at least half of their net worth in the funds, making them relatively more exposed than any of their customers, and they personally go down with the ship. Bailing out banks have removed the last ounce of skin in the game that financial institutions had (if they had any), and, given [what happened to Banco Popular](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/23/business/lessons-from-the-collapse-of-banco-popular.html), something is rotten, forever, in banking, since the time they moved from partnerships to public companies, as told by Michael Lewis in [Liars' Poker](https://www.amazon.com/Liars-Poker-Norton-Paperback-Michael/dp/039333869X).

### Systems learn by removing

We saw that interventionistas don’t learn because they are not the victims of their mistakes. The same mechanism of transferring risk also impedes learning. And more practically, only reality can convince someone that is wrong, no argument can do that.

*The curse of modernity is that we are increasingly populated by a class of people who are better at explaining than understanding*.

It's the Bias-Variance trade-off: explaining overfits your forecast analysis, so the two are at odds with each other.

> Learning isn’t quite what we teach inmates inside the high-security prisons called schools. Evolution can only happen if risk of extinction is present. There is no evolution without skin in the game.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

We need evolution to learn, because it's easier for humans to see what is wrong than what is right. Once we've removed what is wrong, it's necessary that what is left has to be right. That's what we called *via negativa*.

### A brief tour of symmetry

1. Hammurabi

Skin-in-the-game-style symmetry, until the recent intellectualisation of life, had been implicitly considered the principal rule for organised societies. Hammurabi’s law was posted around 3,800 years ago, and has one central theme: it establishes symmetries between people in transaction, so nobody can transfer hidden tail risk, or Bob Rubin-style risks: 'an eye for an eye'.

For, as traders, the best place to hide risks is “in the corners”, in the small letter, in burying vulnerabilities to rare events that only the architect can detect; the idea being to be far away when blowups happen. “I’ll be gone, You’ll be gone”.

2. Golden and Silver rule

The Golden Rule wants you to *treat others the way you would like them to treat you*. The more robust Silver Rule says: *do not treat others the way you would not like them to treat you*.

Why negating is more robust? First, it tells you to mind your own business and not decide what is “good” for others. Second, we know with much more clarity what is bad than what is good (via negativa).

Also, the idea of 'others' works at all scales: humans, tribes, societies, groups of societies, countries, etc…

> I go to other people’s funerals so they come to mine.
>
> -- __Yogi Berra__

Most people miss the point in Matthew 12:21-31, where a servant who has his huge debt waived by a compassionate lender subsequently punishes another servant who owed him a much smaller amount, and they mistakenly think the true message is symmetry, not forgiveness.

3. Kant

Kant’s categorical imperative can be summarised as: *behave as if your action can be generalised to the behaviour of everyone in all places, under all conditions*: as a Universal Law.

Universal behaviour is great on paper, disastrous in practice. We are local, practical animals, and we are sensitive to scale. We need practical rules; the general and the abstract tend to attract self-righteous psychopaths.

The deep message of 'Skin in the Game' is the danger of universalism taken two or three steps too far, conflating the micro and the macro, in the same way that the main idea in [The Black Swan](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness-Fragility/dp/081297381X) was *platonification*, that is, mistaking the map for the territory.

4. Fat Tony

Fat Tony is our archetype: the exact opposite of those belonging to the interventionistas. He is the stereotype of a trader like those portrayed in Liars Poker.

> [Fat Tony] became wealthy by helping people he generally calls “the suckers” separate from their funds (or as it is often the case, those of their clients, as these people often gamble with other people’s money.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

There is always an element of fools of randomness (knowledge) and crooks of randomness (ethics) in matters of uncertainty: the fool takes risks he doesn’t understand, mistaking his own past luck for skills, and the crook transfers risks to others. Economists only talk about the second one.

Reality always knows whether an action is foolish, and skin in the game is always about the real world. Similarly, there is a difference between a charlatan and a genuinely skilled member of society: the doer wins by doing, not convincing. Entire fields (most social sciences) become charlatanic because of the absence of skin in the game connecting them back to reality.

What matters in life isn’t how frequently one is right, but how much one makes when one is right. Being wrong, when it isn’t costly, doesn’t count: you’re doing research.

Exposures in real life are always too complicated to reduce to an ‘event’ easy to describe in words. It is harder for us to reverse-engineer than engineer; we see the result of evolutionary forces but cannot replicate them owing to their casual opacity, a problem that is at the core of Hume thesis: We can only run such processes forward.

Without skin in the game, we fail to get that time removes the fragile and keeps the robust, and the life expectancy of the robust lengthens with time.

What works cannot be irrational. If something stupid works (and makes money), it cannot be stupid.

5. Modernism

Intellectualism is the belief that one can separate an action from the results of such action, that one can separate theory from practice, and that one can always fix complex systems in a top-down manner. It has a sibling: scientism, a naive interpretation of science as complication rather than science as a process and a sceptical enterprise.

Using mathematics when it’s not needed is not science but scientism.

Science has been taken over by vendors using it to sell products and, ironically, the sceptical enterprise is being used to silence sceptics, as  described  in [Against the Professors](https://www.amazon.com/Sextus-Empiricus-Against-Professors-Classical/dp/0674994205).

One of the side effects of the division of jobs proposed by Adam Smith in [The Wealth of Nations](https://www.amazon.com/Wealth-Nations-Adam-Smith/dp/1505577128/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1542738793&sr=1-1&keywords=the+wealth+of+nations) is separating labour from the fruits of labour, the concept of *alienation* described by Karl Marx's [Capital](https://www.amazon.com/Capital-Critique-Political-Economy-Classics/dp/0140445684/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1542738874&sr=1-1&keywords=capital+marx).

### Simplicity

People who see complicated solutions do not have an incentive to implement simplified ones. They are, in fact, harder to come up with, statistically speaking: it's like [parking your car](http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/794/1/falling-cats.pdf). Things designed by people without skin in the game tend to grow in complication: when you are rewarded for perception, not results, you need to show sophistication (it's one of the reasons why inexperienced people, in almost any branch of knowledge, go for the most complex solutions: they have been taught a lot of things in no time, everything is fresh and they were rewarded by perception on their tests).

When there is fire, you run faster than in any competition, and similarly, poker is a much different game when the stakes are real.

What you learn from the intensity and the focus you had when under the influence of risk stays with you. Many kids would learn to love mathematics if they had some investment in it. It's the same when learning a new language; you need to throw yourself into the wild.

### Soul in the game

> If you do not take risks for your opinion, you are nothing.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

Success is leading an honourable life. Honour implies that there are some actions you would categorically never do, regardless of the material rewards; and it also implies that there are things you would do unconditionally, regardless of its consequences. As a Spartan mother tells her departing son: “With it or on it”.

Contrast the above unconditional with modernistic accommodations: people who work for disgusting lobbies or knowingly play the usual unethical academic game, come to grips with their condition by saying things like “I have children to put through college”.

People who are not morally independent tend to fit ethics to their profession rather than find a profession that fits their ethics. That's why, regardless of the extremly cruel conditions in which Khashoggi was tortured and executed, no major government has raised any concerns about the involvement of Saudi Arabia: they are the main buyers and 'job providers' for many industries in many of these countries, in the same fashion that Russia, Eastern Europe's main provider of gas and oil, has the EU hostage pretty much every single winter.

### Entrepreneurs

Entrepreneurs are heroes in our society: they fail for the rest of us.

However, and owing to funding and VC mechanisms, many people mistaken for entrepreneurs fail to have true skin in the game in the sense that their aim is to either cash out by selling the company to Google, Facebook or the likes. The true value of the company and its long-term prospects is of small relevance. This form of entrepreneurship is the equivalent of bringing great-looking and marketable children into the world with the aim of selling them at age four.

One of the reasons corporations have the mortality of cancer patients is the assignment of time-defined duties: once you change assignment, Bob Rubin emerges: “It’s not my problem anymore”.
