Knowledge can mean different things to different people. For taxi drivers in London, ['The Knowledge'](https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/taxis-and-private-hire/licensing/learn-the-knowledge-of-london) is the exam that candidates must pass before sitting behind the wheel of one of the famous black cabs and drive quickly through London's complicated road network. It typically takes three to four years, and those who pass it have an encyclopedic knowledge of the streets and places of interest.

Then, in 2005, Google Maps was invented. The question is: 'Is still worth it to pass The Knowledge?'

Consider the following thought experiment: a naive tourist who have never been to London jumps into a cab, and asks for directions to, say, the London Eye. You, an experienced taxi driver, know your ways into the City, but more importantly, have the upper hand: his final destination is only 5 minutes away. Do you take the oblivious tourist there by the longest and most expensive route?

Well, it's risky. It can go well, and you'll earn an extra £20, perhaps £50... provided that you don't get caught. Because if you do get caught, fire rains upon you: you lose your license, and with it, 4 years of your life learning the intricacies of the London tracks goes to waste.

Now let's do the same thing if you are armed with your brand new smartphone, which has Google Maps on it, and you're good to go as a newly hired Uber driver. Same story again, same naive tourist, same silly route that can be diverted into an extra bonus. Do you fall for it?

Of course you do. In the second case, you don't have __skin in the game__.

> Skin in the game is necessary to understand the world. Do not understand it as ‘incentives’, as it is understood in finance. It is about symmetry, like having a share of the harm, paying a penalty if something goes wrong. Having an exposure to the real world, and paying a price for its consequences, good or bad.

The book we are covering today is [Skin in the Game](https://www.amazon.com/Skin-Game-Hidden-Asymmetries-Daily/dp/042528462X), by Nassim Taleb. It's the last book of a collection called *Incerto*, an investigation of opacity, luck, uncertainty, probability, human error, risk, and decision making when you don't understand the world. If this is the first time yo stumble upon Taleb, he is definitely a unique writer, and perhaps is this book, the latest one in the series, the best gateway to the rest of the Incerto books, as it covers and summarises information from the others, leaving going more deeply into any topic as an exercise to the reader. As with any good reading, the author is going down the rabbit hole along with you, and Skin in the Game is, to me, the culmination of a journey that for Taleb started in 2001 with the publication of [Fooled by Randomness](https://www.amazon.com/Fooled-Randomness-Hidden-Markets-Incerto/dp/0812975219).

> To figure out why ethics, moral obligation, and skill cannot be easily separable in real life, consider the following. When you tell someone in a position of responsibility, say your bookkeeper, "I trust you", do you mean that 1) you trust his ethics (he will not divert money to Panama), 2) you trust his accounting precision, or 3) both?

First, skin in the game is bullshit identification and filtering: *In academia there is no difference between academia and the real world; in the real world, there is*.

Second, if you have the rewards, you must also get some of the risks, not let others pay the price of your mistakes. If you inflict risk on others, and they are harmed, you need to pay some price for it: *Don’t tell me what you ‘think’, tell me what’s in your portfolio*.

Third, the book is about how much information one should practically share with others.

Fourth, it is about rationality and the test of time, as in acknowledging the complexity of our world not through models, but through trial and error.

# Book 1 - Introduction

### The interventionistas

__You cannot separate knowledge from contact with the ground__, it's what the Greeks called *pathemata mathemata* (“guide your learning through pain”). However, our world is ruled by a class of people, the *interventionistas*, who rely on models to represent reality and have forgotten that __the map isn't the territory__, the idea coined by Afred Korzybski that encapsulates that the description of the thing is not the thing itself, that the model isn't the reality, and that the abstraction is not the concrete.

> A collection of people classified as interventionistas who promoted the Iraq invasion of 2003, as well as the removal of [Ghadaffi] are advocating the imposition of additional such regime change on another batch of countries, which includes Syria, because it has a “dictator”. [...] These interventionistas and their friends helped create, train, and support Islamist rebels, “moderates”, who evolved to become part of al-Qaeda, responsible for the attack on the Twin Towers of September 11, 2001.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

As explained in Christopher Phillips’ [The Battle for Syria](https://www.amazon.com/Battle-Syria-International-Rivalry-Middle/dp/030021717X), much of this foreign interference has in fact prolonged the war instead of helping win or shorten it. In the book, Phillips also gives a very good analysis of the Islamic State, noting that IS had ‘many parents’, and that if the Assad regime bore responsibility for it, so did his many international enemies, including Western countries, Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and others, who on earlier occasions supported trends which led to that movement. The story of [Barry Seal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Seal) is a testimony of the lack of scrupulousness of the US government when dealing with international affairs. It's a behaviour that you would never see in a doctor.

Interventionistas not only lack practical sense, and never learn from history, but they even fail at pure reasoning, which they drown in elaborate semiabstract buzzword-laden discourse.

Their three flaws:
1. __They think in statics, not dynamics__:

They are incapable of thinking in second steps and unaware of the need for them.

2. __They think in low, not high, dimensions__:

They can’t get the idea that, empirically, complex systems do not have obvious one-dimensional cause-and-effect mechanisms, and that under opacity, you do not mess with such a system.

3. __They think in terms of actions, never interactions__:
They can’t forecast the evolution of those one helps by attacking, or the magnification one gets from feedback.

> We end up populating what the call ‘the intelligentsia’ with people who are delusional, literally mentally deranged, simply because they never have to pay for the consequences of their actions, repeating modernist slogans stripped of all depth, like “democracy”, while encouraging headcutters.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

In that sense, they aren't that far from the 'populism' that they so vigorously criticise: its solutions resemble the mainstream handling of complex issues, and it's winning not because of a renewed approach to those issues, but because the angle, the narrative is completely brand new, removing any guilt from the people who relied on mainstream politics to solve these problems in the first place.

> __Farage__: "I know that none of you have done a proper job in your lives, or worked in business, or worked in trade, or indeed ever created a job, but listen, just listen".
__Schulz__ [In German]: "Mr Farage, just a second. Ladies and gentlemen, I do understand that you're getting emotional, but you're acting like UKIP [Farage's political party] normally act, so please, don't imitate them. Mr Farage I would say something to you: the fact that you're claiming nobody's ever done a decent job in their life, you can't really say that."
__Farage__: "You're quite right, Mr Schulz, UKIP used to protest against the establishment and now the establishment protests against UKIP, so something has happened here."

> -- [EU Parliament, in the first session since 'Brexit' in Brussels, 28 Jun 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJzRa7HWVqs&t=0s&list=PLBEF4C827963BDDD1&index=5)

The principle should be *do not harm*, not talking about [actions that would be designed to be limited in duration and scope](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/31/barack-obama-statement-us-intervention-syria). Those who don’t take risks should never be involved in making decisions, especially when we are now skilled enough to kill ourselves as a species.

It is, indeed, drawn a comparison between those interventionistas and bureaucrats. Bureaucracy is a construction by which a person is conveniently separated from the consequences of his or her actions. They love formulas because it prevents them from having to exercise judgment for which they might be blamed.

### Bob Rubin trade

When Taleb wrote [The Black Swan](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness-Fragility/dp/081297381X), he probably didn't expect the repercusion it got, but he definitely wouldn't have thought that people who read it and were in a position of power didn't understand it, especially if that includes the former Secretary of the Treasury, Robert Rubin.

> Bob Rubin, [...] one of those who sign their names on the banknote you just used to pay for coffee, collected more than $120 million in compensation from Citibank in the decade preceding the banking crash of 2008. When the bank, literally insolvent, was rescued by the taxpayer, he didn't write any check— he invoked uncertainty as an excuse. Heads he wins, tails he shouts "Black Swan"
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

The book [Other People's Money](https://www.amazon.com/Other-Peoples-Money-Business-Finance/dp/1610397150) talks about this problem in more depth, and the concept of *clawback* bonuses, that is, taking it back, possibly with an added penalty, in the event that something that results of their actions ends up badly.

This is the main consequence of bailouts: government interference in general tends to remove skin in the game. The same happened in financial markets: the risk taking business started moving toward small independent structures known as hedge funds, mostly because of the overbureaucratization of the system as paper shufflers overburdened the banks with [rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_III), but avoided considering skin in the game. In the decentralised hedge fund space, on the other hand, owner-operators have at least half of their net worth in the funds, making them relatively more exposed than any of their customers, and they personally go down with the ship. Bailing out banks have removed the last ounce of skin in the game that financial institutions had (if they had any), and, given [what happened to Banco Popular](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/23/business/lessons-from-the-collapse-of-banco-popular.html), something is rotten, forever, in banking, since the time they moved from partnerships to public companies, as told by Michael Lewis in [Liars' Poker](https://www.amazon.com/Liars-Poker-Norton-Paperback-Michael/dp/039333869X).

### Systems learn by removing

We saw that interventionistas don’t learn because they are not the victims of their mistakes. The same mechanism of transferring risk also impedes learning. And more practically, only reality can convince someone that is wrong, no argument can do that.

*The curse of modernity is that we are increasingly populated by a class of people who are better at explaining than understanding*.

It's the Bias-Variance trade-off: explaining overfits your forecast analysis, so the two are at odds with each other.

> Learning isn’t quite what we teach inmates inside the high-security prisons called schools. Evolution can only happen if risk of extinction is present. There is no evolution without skin in the game.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

We need evolution to learn, because it's easier for humans to see what is wrong than what is right. Once we've removed what is wrong, it's necessary that what is left has to be right. That's what we called *via negativa*.

### A brief tour of symmetry

1. Hammurabi

Skin-in-the-game-style symmetry, until the recent intellectualisation of life, had been implicitly considered the principal rule for organised societies. Hammurabi’s law was posted around 3,800 years ago, and has one central theme: it establishes symmetries between people in transaction, so nobody can transfer hidden tail risk, or Bob Rubin-style risks: 'an eye for an eye'.

For, as traders, the best place to hide risks is “in the corners”, in the small letter, in burying vulnerabilities to rare events that only the architect can detect; the idea being to be far away when blowups happen. “I’ll be gone, You’ll be gone”.

2. Golden and Silver rule

The Golden Rule wants you to *treat others the way you would like them to treat you*. The more robust Silver Rule says: *do not treat others the way you would not like them to treat you*.

Why negating is more robust? First, it tells you to mind your own business and not decide what is “good” for others. Second, we know with much more clarity what is bad than what is good (via negativa).

Also, the idea of 'others' works at all scales: humans, tribes, societies, groups of societies, countries, etc…

> I go to other people’s funerals so they come to mine.
>
> -- __Yogi Berra__

Most people miss the point in Matthew 12:21-31, where a servant who has his huge debt waived by a compassionate lender subsequently punishes another servant who owed him a much smaller amount, and they mistakenly think the true message is symmetry, not forgiveness.

3. Kant

Kant’s categorical imperative can be summarised as: *behave as if your action can be generalised to the behaviour of everyone in all places, under all conditions*: as a Universal Law.

Universal behaviour is great on paper, disastrous in practice. We are local, practical animals, and we are sensitive to scale. We need practical rules; the general and the abstract tend to attract self-righteous psychopaths.

The deep message of 'Skin in the Game' is the danger of universalism taken two or three steps too far, conflating the micro and the macro, in the same way that the main idea in [The Black Swan](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness-Fragility/dp/081297381X) was *platonification*, that is, mistaking the map for the territory.

4. Fat Tony

Fat Tony is our archetype: the exact opposite of those belonging to the interventionistas. He is the stereotype of a trader like those portrayed in Liars Poker.

> [Fat Tony] became wealthy by helping people he generally calls “the suckers” separate from their funds (or as it is often the case, those of their clients, as these people often gamble with other people’s money.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

There is always an element of fools of randomness (knowledge) and crooks of randomness (ethics) in matters of uncertainty: the fool takes risks he doesn’t understand, mistaking his own past luck for skills, and the crook transfers risks to others. Economists only talk about the second one.

Reality always knows whether an action is foolish, and skin in the game is always about the real world. Similarly, there is a difference between a charlatan and a genuinely skilled member of society: the doer wins by doing, not convincing. Entire fields (most social sciences) become charlatanic because of the absence of skin in the game connecting them back to reality.

What matters in life isn’t how frequently one is right, but how much one makes when one is right. Being wrong, when it isn’t costly, doesn’t count: you’re doing research.

Exposures in real life are always too complicated to reduce to an ‘event’ easy to describe in words. It is harder for us to reverse-engineer than engineer; we see the result of evolutionary forces but cannot replicate them owing to their casual opacity, a problem that is at the core of Hume thesis: We can only run such processes forward.

Without skin in the game, we fail to get that time removes the fragile and keeps the robust, and the life expectancy of the robust lengthens with time.

What works cannot be irrational. If something stupid works (and makes money), it cannot be stupid.

5. Modernism

Intellectualism is the belief that one can separate an action from the results of such action, that one can separate theory from practice, and that one can always fix complex systems in a top-down manner. It has a sibling: scientism, a naive interpretation of science as complication rather than science as a process and a sceptical enterprise.

Using mathematics when it’s not needed is not science but scientism.

Science has been taken over by vendors using it to sell products and, ironically, the sceptical enterprise is being used to silence sceptics, as  described  in [Against the Professors](https://www.amazon.com/Sextus-Empiricus-Against-Professors-Classical/dp/0674994205).

> As things get more technological, there is a growing separation between the maker and the user.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

One of the side effects of the division of jobs proposed by Adam Smith in [The Wealth of Nations](https://www.amazon.com/Wealth-Nations-Adam-Smith/dp/1505577128/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1542738793&sr=1-1&keywords=the+wealth+of+nations) is separating labour from the fruits of labour, the concept of *alienation* described by Karl Marx's [Capital](https://www.amazon.com/Capital-Critique-Political-Economy-Classics/dp/0140445684/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1542738874&sr=1-1&keywords=capital+marx).

### Simplicity

People who see complicated solutions do not have an incentive to implement simplified ones. They are, in fact, harder to come up with, statistically speaking: it's like [parking your car](http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/794/1/falling-cats.pdf). Things designed by people without skin in the game tend to grow in complication: when you are rewarded for perception, not results, you need to show sophistication (it's one of the reasons why inexperienced people, in almost any branch of knowledge, go for the most complex solutions: they have been taught a lot of things in no time, everything is fresh and they were rewarded by perception on their tests).

When there is fire, you run faster than in any competition, and similarly, poker is a much different game when the stakes are real.

What you learn from the intensity and the focus you had when under the influence of risk stays with you. Many kids would learn to love mathematics if they had some investment in it. It's the same when learning a new language; you need to throw yourself into the wild.

### Soul in the game

> If you do not take risks for your opinion, you are nothing.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

Success is leading an honourable life. Honour implies that there are some actions you would categorically never do, regardless of the material rewards; and it also implies that there are things you would do unconditionally, regardless of its consequences. As a Spartan mother tells her departing son: “With it or on it”.

Contrast the above unconditional with modernistic accommodations: people who work for disgusting lobbies or knowingly play the usual unethical academic game, come to grips with their condition by saying things like “I have children to put through college”.

People who are not morally independent tend to fit ethics to their profession rather than find a profession that fits their ethics. That's why, regardless of the extremly cruel conditions in which Khashoggi was tortured and executed, no major government has raised any concerns about the involvement of Saudi Arabia: they are the main buyers and 'job providers' for many industries in many of these countries, in the same fashion that Russia, Eastern Europe's main provider of gas and oil, has the EU hostage pretty much every single winter.

### Entrepreneurs

Entrepreneurs are heroes in our society: they fail for the rest of us.

However, many entrepreneurs fail to have true skin in the game, as VC mechanisms remove them from the possibility of long term profitability and channel their efforts towards selling their company to the big players. The true value of the company and its long-term prospects is of small relevance.

One of the reasons corporations have the mortality of cancer patients is the assignment of time-defined duties: once you change assignment, Bob Rubin emerges: “It’s not my problem anymore”.

### How the book is organised

Skin in the Game is organised in sections, or books, with Book 1 being the introduction that we have gone through already.

__Book 2__ is a deeper exposition of symmetry and agency in risk sharing, bridging commercial conflict of interest with general ethics.

__Book 3__ is about the minority rule by which a small segment of the population inflicts its preferences on the general population.

__Book 4__ deals with dependence and slavery in modern life: why employees exist because they have much more to lose than contractors.

__Book 5__ shows how risk taking makes you look superficially less attractive, but vastly more convincing, the concept of “Intellectual Yet Idiot”, inequality, and the Lindy effect.

__Book 6__ looks for consequential hidden asymmetries.

__Book 7__ explains creeds in terms of skin in the game and revealed preferences, and the word ‘religion’.

__Book 8__ has the two central chapters: ‘How to be Rational about Rationality’, which goes deep into what rationality really is; and ‘The Logic of Risk Taking’, which summarises the author’s tenets about risk and exposes the errors concerning small-probability events.

# Book 2 - A first look at Agency

## Chapter 1 - Why each one should eat his own turtles

*Beware of the person who gives advice, telling you that a certain action on your part is ‘good for you’, while it is also good for him, while the harm to you doesn’t directly affect him*.

> I worked once for an US investment bank. As with all such firms, an image of ethics and professionalism was cultivated. [...] But the job of the salespeople was to ‘unload’ inventory with which traders were ‘stuffed’, that is, securities they had in excess in their books and needed to get rid of to lower their risk profile. Selling to other dealers was out of the question as professional traders would smell excess inventory and cause the price to drop, so they needed to sell to some client.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

As the Romans were fully aware, *plenius aqua Iaudat venal qui vault extruder merces*, “one lauds merrily the merchandise to get rid of it”.

### The Price of Corn in Rhodes

“Giving advice” as a sales pitch is fundamentally unethical, selling cannot be deemed advice. You can do one or the other, but the two need to be kept separate. As per banks and investment firms, there is the concept of Chinese Wall, in which sections within the bank dedicated to sell and advice cannot speak to each other. Just the fact that these two sections can cohabit the same building smells funny: the mechanism itself is likely to be more permeable than what they can concede.

Assume that a man brought a large shipment of corn from Alexandria to Rhodes, at a time when corn was expensive in Rhodes because of shortage and famine. Suppose that he also knew that many boats had set sail from Alexandria to Rhodes with similar merchandise. *Does he have to inform the Rhodians*?

Traders would jump quickly to 'stuff', so long as it is done to the anonymous market and the faceless non-readers, or those called “the Swiss”, some random suckers far away. There were people with whom we had a relational rapport, much like the case with domestic animals that cannot be harmed while rules on cruelty are lifted when it comes to cockroaches.

The rule should go, then, as follows:

>No person in a transaction should have certainty about the outcome while the other has uncertainty.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

Let's explore some particular cases: insider trading would be banned, and arbitrage, but if there is a weak form of asymmetry, say just an edge instead of complete certainty about the future, this doesn’t cover it, as some forms of insider trading are like these. For instance, is Robert Foster Winans, a columnist who tipped stockbrokers on the content of his columns, going against this rule?

The medieval rabbi Rashi relates the following story. Rav Safra was selling goods for sale. A buyer came as he was praying in silence, tried to purchase the merchandise at an initial price, and given that Rav did not reply, raised the price. But he had no intention of selling at a higher price than the initial offer, and felt that he had to honour the initial intention. *Is Rav Safra obligated to sell at the initial price, or should he take the improved one*?

It may not be ethically required, but the most effective, shame-free policy is maximal transparency, even of intentions. But recall what Kant said: theory is too theoretical. The more confined our ethics, the better it works.

> Sympathy for all would be tyranny for thee, my good neighbour
>
> -- __Nietzsche__

"Moral is what brings advantage to my friends", I heard someone say. For the exclusion of 'the suckers' in this conversation is not trivial: a country isn't a big city, a city isn't a big family. Athenians, when talking about 'democracy', were applying it to a restricted set of 'citizens', not slaves or immigrants, and when Jewish talk about blood, they distinguish the 'thick' from the 'thin': *we are all brothers, but some are more brothers than others*.

Free citizens, in ancient and post-classical societies, were traditionally part of clubs, and as club members know, the very purpose of it is exclusion and size limitation. What is the connotation of the President of the US being 'the leader of the free world' when freedomhouse.org estimates that only 39% of world population is effectively free?

It is unfortunate, but the general kills the particular. For whenever the “we” becomes too large a club, things degrade, and each one starts fighting for his own interest. Dunbar's number refers to that cognitive limit to the number of people whom one can maintain stable social relationships. Being somewhat tribal is not a bad thing, and we have to work in a fractal way in the organised harmonious relations between tribes, rather than merge all tribes in one large soup, like it happened in Lebanon, a country that was known as ‘The Switzerland of the East” during the 60s, and eventually faced the horrors of war in 1975 due to demographic tensions. Blaming people for being ‘sectarian’ instead of making the best of such tendency is one of the stupidities of interventionistas.

> You know instinctively that people get along better as neighbours than roommates.

> -- __Skin in the Game__

Modernity put in our heads that there are two units, the individual and the universal collective, when in reality, my skin lies in a broader set of people, one that includes my family, a community, a tribe, a fraternity, but cannot possibly be universal.

Once we've passed the limit of what we consider a 'we', communal behaviour cease to apply, and consequences described in the [Tragedy of the Commons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr5Q3VvpI7w) begin to take place. “Me” is more likely to be a group than a single person.

### Trying to remove skin in the game

There are two types of “talking one’s book”. One consists of buying a stock because you like it, then commenting on it– the most reliable advocate for a product is its user. No amount of advertising will match the credibility of a genuine user. Another is buying a stock so you can advertise the qualities of the company, then selling it, benefiting from the trumpeting– this is called market manipulation, and it is certainly a conflict of interest.

We removed the skin in the game of journalists in order to prevent market manipulation. The arguments in this book are that market manipulation and conflicts of interest are more benign than impunity for bad advice. In the abscence of skin in the game, journalists will imitate, to be safe, the opinion of other journalists, thus creating a monoculture and collective mirages.

In general, skin in the game comes with conflict of interests; the former is just more important than the latter.

Take doctors for instance; doctors don’t have that problem by themselves: medicine is fundamentally apprenticeship-based and grounded in experience.

The problem resides in the reliance of metrics. Every metric is gameable. Attempts at putting skin in the game there have brought a certain class of adverse effects, in shifting uncertainty from the doctor to the patient.

A doctor is pushed by the system to transfer risk from himself to you, and from the present into the future, or from the intermediate future into a more distant future.

You need to remember that, when you visit a medical office (and probably everyone’s office) you will be facing someone who, in spite of his authoritative demeanour, is in a fragile situation. He has no direct emotional loss should your health experience a degradation. His objective is, naturally, to avoid a lawsuit.

The doctor is pressured to treat you to protect himself. The pharmaceutical companies have managed to convince everyone that unseen consequences are harmless, when in reality the medical risks are hidden. Should you drop dead a few weeks after the visit, the doctor faces a lawsuit: thus, he is pressured to prescribe medicine to you, even if he knows deep down that it is harmful.

That is no different from the Bob Rubin trade.

The solution is for the patient to avoid treatment when he or she is mildly ill, but use medicine for rarely encountered severe conditions. The problem is that the mildly ill represents a much larger pool of people than the severely ill (and are expected to live longer and consume drugs for longer), hence pharmaceutical companies have an incentive to focus on them.

# Book 3 - The Greatest Asymmetry

## Chapter 2 - The most intolerant wins: the dominance of the stubborn minority

The main idea behind complex systems is that the ensemble behaves in ways not predict by its components. This is called an “emergent” property of the whole, in which parts and whole differ because what matters are the interactions between such parts.

When a group of people is gathered, and a decision has to be taken, a naive observer would be under the impression that the choices and preferences are those of the majority. What is really going on is that, usually, a stubborn minority, once it reaches a small proportion of the group, decides for the whole.

*The minority rule*: __It suffices for an intransigent minority with significant skin in the game to reach a minutely small level for the entire population to have to submit to their preferences__.

There are two main things to consider:

- The geography of the terrain matters a bit: its makes a big difference whether the intransigents are in their own district or are mixed with the rest of the population.

- The cost structure matters a bit: so long as the price doesn’t change much, the rule applies.

Let’s call such minority an intransigent group, and the majority a flexible one. And their relationship rests on asymmetry in choices: the intransigent only chooses one option between two, whereas the flexible doesn’t care.

1. A kosher (or halal) eater will never eat non kosher (or non halal) food, but a non kosher eater isn’t banned from eating kosher.

2. A disabled person will not use the regular bathroom, but a non disabled person will use the bathroom for disabled people.

3. Someone with a peanut (or gluten) allergy will not eat products that touch peanuts (or gluten), but a person without such allergy can eat items with peanut (or gluten) traces I them.

4. Cars (and even food) are advertised as “made in [your country]”, because there is a minority of people who care deeply about “our” jobs.

The method of analysis employed here is called a “renormalisation group”, the mathematical apparatus used in Physics that allows systematic investigation of the changes of a physical system as viewed at different scales, and it has been used due to the fact [that the laws of Physics that govern the atomic level are at odds with those that rule stars and galaxies](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/nov/04/relativity-quantum-mechanics-universe-physicists).

![renormalisation](/assets/renormalisation.png)

It opposes the mean-field approach, when one replaces all interactions to any one body with an average or effective interaction, sometimes called a molecular field. This reduces any multi-body problem into an effective one-body problem. The ease of solving MFT problems means that some insight into the behavior of the system can be obtained at a relatively low cost. If there is a way to make a clear distinction between Physics and Chemistry, is this: Chemistry is the result of applying MFT to Physics.

### Veto

The minority rule can also be applied to why some well known chains such as McDonald’s or Starbucks thrive: because they are not vetoed in a certain socio-economic group. They are a best worse-case divergence from expectations: if I travel to a foreign country I might risk it with some local food or play safe and take a Happy Meal. In parties, pizza and wine is the same story. Pizza is a commonly accepted food, and nobody would be blamed for ordering it in a get together. And once you have a small amount of women at a party, you cannot serve only beer. But most men will drink wine. So you only need a set of glasses if you serve only wine.

### Languages

If a meeting is taking place in Germany in a corporation that is sufficiently international, and one of the persons in the room doesn’t speak German, the entire meeting will be run, of course, in English. Because once it was settled that English was the lingua franca, native speakers lost the incentive to learn a new language, and everyone else had the incentive to learn English.

It's the same in the Spanish region of Catalonia: so long as the impact and the cost of your labelling is low (milk bricks, local TV ads, generic station announcements, display window labelling), everything is in Catalan, not in Spanish.

Language travels so much faster than genes: it shows us the recent mistake of building racial theories on language, dividing people into “Aryans” and “Semites”, based on linguistic considerations.

### Religions

The minority rules also applies, of course, to prohibitions.

*Outcomes are paradoxically more stable under the minority rule: the variance of the results is lower and the rule is more likely to emerge independently across separate populations*.

That is because you aren’t required numbers, but determination, and determination doesn’t go away easily.

*What emerges from the minority rule is more likely to be black-and-white, binary rules. (Note: Self evident*

That is Bayes Rule: conditional to the rule having been applied, it is far more likely that it came from those who imposed it, not those who compromised.

The formation of moral values in society doesn’t come from the evolution of consensus, but from the most intolerant people’s imposing virtue on others precisely because of that intolerance. In the same manner, the spread of Islam in the Near East, where Christianity  was heavily entrenched can be attributed to two asymmetries.

1. Under Islamic law, if a non-Muslim man marries a Muslim woman, he needs to convert to Islam, and if either parent of a child happens to be Muslim, the child will be Muslim.

2. Becoming a Muslim is irreversible, as apostasy is the heaviest crime under the religion.

All one needs is a small rate of interfaith marriages. Islam out-stubborned Christianity, which itself won thanks to its own stubbornness. For before Islam, the original spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire was largely due to the blinding intolerance of Christians.

> I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me
>
> -- John 14:6

Roman pagans were initially tolerant to Christians. But Christians weren’t tolerant of Roman paganism. The “persecution” of the Christians had vastly more to do with the intolerance of the Christians for the pantheon of local gods than the reverse, as described in [The Darkening Age](https://www.amazon.es/Darkening-Age-Christian-Destruction-Classical/dp/1509812326?SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&tag=duckduckgo-ffab-es-21&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1509812326)

Remember that what we read is written by the Christian side: the Constantinian shift is *fake news*.

We know too little about the Roman perspective during the rise of Christianity, as biographies of saints have dominated the discourse. There are endless accounts of Christians martyrs and saints, but very little is known of pagan heroes. Even the early Christians have been expurgated from the record, in a fashion that led Dan Brown to reveal the world what most subject matter experts already knew: that there are codices being written about Jesus Christ outside the Bible, like the The Nag Hammadi Library, which may have been hidden after Saint Athanasius condemned the use of non-canonical books in his Festal Letter of 367 A.D. We are discovering that branches such as the Gnostics had a quite different record of the early religion, closed to outsiders and secret about their own records.

This also happened much later: when Spaniards started colonising South America, they found the Incas, whose religion was mostly animistic and acknowledging gods like heavenly bodies to mountains and rivers, even ancestors. It was a religion that, being oral, was less prescriptive than those based upon books such as the Bible or the Quran.

Confronted by such certainties, backed by coercive force, the more open-ended, absorbent oral religions of Africa or the Americas were simply overwhelmed.

### Popper-Gödel paradox

In 1931, Kurt Gödel published his incompleteness theorems in "On Formally Undecidable Propositions of "Principia Mathematica" and Related Systems”. The basic idea at the heart of the incompleteness theorem is rather simple: a system cannot prove its own consistency.

*The next statement is false. The previous statement is true*.

Self referencing is always problematic, and that is at the core of Gödel’s theorems.

We've introduced this because the question is, __can democracy tolerate enemies?__ Would you agree to deny the freedom of speech to every political party that has in its charter the banning the freedom of speech? Can states allow independent parties when independence goes against the Constitution?

Should a society that has elected to be tolerant be intolerant about intolerance?

This is in fact [the incoherence that Gödel detected in the United States Constitution](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9_mR_M2zOc4Y2VhNzZkMDQtMDdlNC00YWQ0LWJlYzQtMzAxZjAxMGYxNzM5/view), while Karl Popper independently discovered the same inconsistency in democratic systems and published in [The Open Society and its Enemies](https://www.amazon.com/Open-Society-Its-Enemies-One/dp/0691158134).

Thomas Shelling [showed](https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/SchellingsModelOfResidentialSegregation/) how a neighbourhood can be segregated without a single segregationist among its inhabitants. Yes, an intolerant minority can will eventually destroy democracy.

### Markets and science

Now consider markets. Price changes reflect the activities of the most motivated buyer and seller.

All you need is a stubborn single seller to drive the price down 10%. The market is like a large movie theatre with a small door. Stampedes happen in cinemas (try shouting “fire!”) because those who want to be out do not want to be in: the same unconditionality that we see with kosher observance.

Science acts similarly: Science isn’t a consensus, but a highly skewed procedure. Once you debunk something, it is now wrong. (The reality is a bit more complicated than that: we don’t teach Newton because it’s true, but because its a gateway towards understanding Einstein better).

# Book 4 - Wolves among dogs

## Chapter 3 - How to own another person

__Complete freedom is the last thing you want if you have an organisation to run__.

Every organisation wants a certain number of people associated with it and be deprived of a certain share of their freedom. How do you own them?

1. Conditioning and psychological manipulation
2. Tweaking them to have some skin in the game, to have something to lose if they disobey

In the orders of the mafia, things are simple: made men can be whacked if the capo suspects a lack of allegiance. For other professions, skin in the game comes in a more subtle forms.

### To own a pilot

What a contractor pilot would do, selling himself to the highest bidder and leave you on your own without any shed of doubt, isn’t something that employees would. People who are employees for a living don’t behave so opportunistically. Contractors are exceedingly risk-free; they fear mostly the law. But employees have a reputation to protect, and can be fired.

> “—Why did the school authorities veto the plan to have you give the talk that became "What You'll Wish You'd Known?"
> "—They didn't have anything against me specifically, but because I wouldn't be coming from any organization, they wouldn't have any guarantee I wouldn't say dangerous things. Whereas if I came to speak from IBM or the State Department, and told the students they should all go out and try heroin, I'd be fired.”
>
> -- __Paul Graham__ (http://paulgraham.com/gfaq.html))

Employees are reliable, but also expensive: you have to pay them even if you have nothing for them to do. Lovers of pay checks are lazy, but they would never let you down when a highest bidder appears for a one-time gig. They exist because they have a significant skin in the game, and from them you buy dependability.

Dependability is a driver in many transactions: you have a car so that you want it to be available when you need it, and so is a house on the beach useful for.

*Never buy when you can rent the three F’s: Float, Fly and Fuck*. Yet many people own boats and planes, and end up stuck in marriage.

> Evidence of submission is displayed by the employee’s going through years depriving himself of his personal freedom for nine hours every day, ritualistic and punctual arrival at an office, his denying himself his own schedule, and his not having beaten up anyone on the way back home after a bad day. He is an obedient, housebroken dog.

### From the companies man to the companies person

Have you ever been told to study something 'useful'? There are numerous [studies](https://bankrate.com/career/most-valuable-college-majors) on "the most valuable college majors", with the idea that *the only real path to earn a living is through being employed by someone else*. That's why Actuarial Science (aka Economics) does so well in these rankings: they are the most 'useful', whereas 'miscellaneous arts' is dead last.

Funny enough, even the wording is signaling something: the term 'miscellaneous arts' is how someone who has a degree that isn't related to liberal arts would refer to liberal arts (and you could argue that using 'miscellaneous' here is pejorative); 'actuarial science' is a term that an economist would use to peg their major to real STEM degrees like Computer Science or Engineer.

> Being an actuary is the best job in America because you get paid like doctors and lawyers, but you don't have to work with blood or visit your clients in jail.
>
> -- __Krzysztof Ostaszewski__, director of the actuarial program at Illionis State University

I never in my life have encounter a doctor defining himself as 'working with blood'. The usefulness of a degree trumps everything else.

I bring this up because we are witnessing what Taleb referred to the shift between 'the companies man to the companies person'.

> Throughout the twentieth century [firms stay in the S&P 500 for] more than 60 [years]. There was such a thing as a company man; people stayed with large firms for their entire lives.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

The company man is best defined as someone whose identity is impregnated with the stamp his firm wants to give him. A company man is someone who feels that he has something huge to lose if he doesn’t behave as a company man– that is, he has skin in the game.

In return, the firm is bound by a pact to keep the company man on the books as long as feasible, after which he would go play golf with a comfortable pension, with former coworkers as partners.

> By the 1990s, however, the technological revolution that took place in Silicon Valley put traditional companies under financial threat. These company men realised that the low-risk profile that came with the big brands wasn’t so low risk. These people couldn’t find a job elsewhere; they were of no use to anyone outside the organisation they have been working for so long.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

The huge layoffs that came as the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2008 serve as the definite proof that the implicit agreement between the company man and the company is no longer valid. And with it comes the realisation that studying a pragmatic degree, regardless of its value to society as a whole, is the new normal.

> If the company man is sort of gone, he has been placed by the companies person. For people are no longer owned by a company, but by something worse: employability. The employable person is embedded in an industry, with fear of upsetting not just their employee, but other potential employees.

When conditions are dire, students turn to "occupation-specific majors", Jaison Abel, head of regional analysis at the New York Fed, [commented to the New York Times in 2016](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/education/edlife/a-brighter-job-market-for-some.html). That's how they are making sure that, wherever they go, they'll be employable. Who cares about what is your degree, so long as it gets you somewhere.

> Outside the firm, price movements direct production, which is co-ordinated through a series of exchange transactions on the market. Within a firm, these market transactions are eliminated and in place of the complicated market structure with exchange transactions is substituted the entrepreneur-coordinator, who directs production. It is clear that these are alternative methods of coordinating production. Yet, having regard to the fact that, if production is regulated by price movements, production could be carried on without any organization at all might we ask, why is there any organization?
>
> -- __Ronald Coase__, [The Nature of the Firm](http://www3.nccu.edu.tw/~jsfeng/CPEC11.pdf)

Ronald Coase was the first to shed light on why firms exist. For him, contracts can be too costly to negotiate due to transaction costs; the solution is to incorporate your business and hire employees; on the other side of the fence, a free market determine specialisation, and information travels via price point, which will cause the firm to aim for the optimal ratio of employees and outside contractors.

Had Coase had any interest in the ancients, he would have discovered that Romans had a slave for treasurer, because you can inflict a much higher punishment on a slave, and you don’t need to rely on the mechanisms of law for that.

> In a world in which products are increasingly made by subcontractors with increasing degrees of specialization, employees are even more necessary than before for some specific, delicate tasks, which explains why today things appear to run smoothly and efficiently, but errors are costlier and delays are considerably longer than in the past.

### A curious form of slave ownership

> The best slave is someone you overpay and who knows it, terrified of losing his status.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

In a famous tale by Ahiqar, later picked up by Aesop, the dog boasts to the wolf all the contraptions of comfort and luxury he has, almost prompting the wolf to enlist. Until the wolf asks the dog about his collar and is terrified when he understands its use.

> “What is that on your neck?”, asked the Wolf. “Nothing at all,” replied the Dog. “What! nothing!”, “Oh, just a trifle!”. “But please tell me.” begged the Wolf.
> “Perhaps you see the mark of the collar to which my chain is fastened.”
> “What! A chain!” cried the Wolf. “Don’t you go wherever you please?”
> “Not always! But what’s the difference?” replied the Dog.
> “All the difference in the world! I don’t care a rap for your feasts and I wouldn’t take all the tender young lambs in the world at that price.” And away ran the Wolf to the woods.

Another aspect of the dog vs wolf dilemma: a wolf is trained to survive. Employees abandoned by their employers cannot bounce back. That is why unemployment in countries such as Spain is dramatic: loads of people were laid off, loads of people who couldn’t help themselves.

![security](/assets/security.JPG)

There is a category of employees who aren’t slaves, but these represent a small proportion of the pool. One type was the salesperson whose resignation could cause a loss of business. The other type was the trader about whom only one thing mattered: profit and losses.

Note also the linguistic dimension: those who use foul language on social networks are sending an expensive signal that they are free- and, ironically, competent (numerous examples of this, of which Donald Trump is the clearest). You don’t signal competence if you don’t take risks for it. So, cursing today is an status symbol, just as oligarchs in Moscow wear blue jeans at special events to signal their power.

>  What matters isn’t what a person has or doesn’t have; it is what he or she is afraid of losing.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

Take for instance the EU leaders, confronting Russia's current president Vladimir Putin. Clearly, except for Putin, all the others need to be elected, can come under fire by their party, and have to calibrate every single statement with how it could be misinterpreted the least by the press. In such a confrontation, Putin looks and acts like a free citizen confronting slaves.

Likewise, it is much trustworthy to deal with the owner of a business than some employee who might be gone tomorrow. *People whose survival depends on qualitative ‘job assessments’ by someone of higher rank in an organisation cannot be trusted for critical decisions*.

The employee has a very simple objective function: fulfil his tasks or satisfy some gameable metric.

We see that with the West attitude towards Saudi Arabia. It has become clear that someone in that country is involved in the assasination of Khashoggi. However, no bureaucrat, fearful of the economic consequences made a move. You can see how, when there is no downside, governments like in the US are willing to sacrifice civilian lives to 'remove a dictator', but when there is skin in the game, they all freeze, or keep doing what they've been doing: business.

The same thing happened with the banks in 2009: the Obama administration was complicit with the Bob Rubin trade. He remove any skin in the game for bankers, thus likely reinforcing the idea that profits accrue to bankers while loses are mutualised.

Now compare these policies to ones in which decision makers have skin in the game as a substitute for their annual ‘job assessment’ and you will picture a different world.

## Chapter 4 - The skin of others in your game

Imagine working for a corporation that produces a (so far) hidden harm to the community, in concealing a property that kills thousands by an effect that is not (yet) fully visible.

You could alert the public, but you would automatically lose your job, without the certainty that a public trial may leave you humiliated for years, which is what happened to [Gilles-Éric Séralini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A9ralini_affair). Until he won his defamation suit against Monsanto, he lived in total disgrace. Oddly enough, both the [leaded gasoline]() and CFCs were both embarrasing cases in our science history invented by [Thomas Midgley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Midgley_Jr.), as brillantly explained in Bill Byrson's book [A short history of nearly everything](https://www.amazon.es/Short-History-Nearly-Everything-Bryson/dp/0552151742?SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&tag=duckduckgo-ffab-es-21&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0552151742).

In any case, as with whistleblowers, even if you end up vindicated, it may that time for the truth to emerge over the noise created by corporate shills. Meanwhile, you pay the price. You are severely conflicted between your obligation to the collective and to your progeny. You feel you are part of the crime, and unless you do something, you are an agent.

### Being ethical comes at a huge costs to others

[In the climax of 'Batman vs Superman'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDsVT7hXm54#t=1m16s), the cape crusader is about to kill Superman, whom he sees as the ultimate no-skin-in-the-game enemy, but something finally prevents him from doing it: the realisation that Superman has a mother, someone he cares for, someone for whom he would compromise his ethics.

Society likes saints and moral heroes to be celibate so they do not have family pressures that may force them into the dilemma of needing to compromise their sense of ethics to feed their children: __To make ethical choices you cannot have dilemmas between the particular (friends, family) and the general__.

That's the main driver for Venezuelan voters: [the widespread reliance on subsidies to buy groceries](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/world/americas/venezuela-election-president-maduro-food.html).

Intellectual and ethical freedom requires the absence of skin of others into one’s game, which is why the free are so rare.

### How to put skin in the game of suicide bombers

Can someone punish a family for the crimes of an individual? The scriptures are self-contradictory:

> The Lord passed by before him and proclaimed: “The Lord, the Lord, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, and abounding in loyal love and faithfulness, 7 keeping loyal love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin. But he by no means leaves the guilty unpunished, responding to the transgression of fathers by dealing with children and children’s children, to the third and fourth generation.”
>
> __Exodus 34:6-7__

> Fathers must not be put to death for what their children do, nor children for what their fathers do; each must be put to death for his own sin.
>
> __Deu 24:16__

However, the answer is clear in the case of the terrorist who thinks he is immune to harm: *You killed my family with supposed impunity; I will make yours pay some indirect price for it*.

This also applies [if you commit suicide by jumping in front of a train in Japan](https://www.economist.com/news/2009/02/06/home-again-home-again).

> Indeed, the train companies have got the business of cleaning up the mess down to a fine art, sometimes in less than 15 minutes, while commuters are handed excuse-notes to show their employers. Meanwhile, the grief of the deceased's family is heightened by having to bring a perverse kind of blood money—up to ¥3m ($34,000) as compensation to the railway company.

# Book 5 -  Being alive means taking certain risks

## Chapter 5 - Life in the simulation machine

Have you noticed how unusual it is that Christianity, among all religions, is the only one that believes in a God that is also a man? It's not like Ancient Greek gods: the conquests of Zeus among nymphs and the mythic mortal progenitors of Hellenic dynasties are famous; nor is it buddhism, which is more a collection of traditions, beliefs and spiritual practices based on teachings attributed to the Buddha than an actual religion.

The Christian religion kept insisting on the dual nature of Jesus Christ: divine and humane. It would be theologically simpler if God were god and Jesus were man, just like any other prophet.

> The Church founders really wanted Christ to have skin in the game; he did actually suffer on the cross, sacrifice himself, and experience death.
>
> -- __Skin in the Game__

A god who didn’t really suffer on the cross would be like a magician who performed an illusion. The human nature of Christ is what makes the divine possible for all of us.

It's the same when you play poker using fake money: you don't behave the same, you're more reckless, because there is no downside. Being in 'The Matrix' changes it all completely. It's like that movie called '[The Edge of Tomorrow](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1631867/)': Tom Cruise cannot die, so he keeps on doing it again and again to experiment strategies to win the war.

The IYI seems ubiquitous in our lives but is a small minority, rarely seen outside specialised outlets, think tanks, media, and university. He pathologises others for doing things he doesn’t understand without even realising it is his understanding that may be limited. He thinks people should act according to their best interests and he knows their interest, particularly if they are ‘rednecks’ or from the English non-crisp-vowel class who voted Brexit.

When plebeians do something that doesn’t make sense to IYI, he uses the term ‘uneducated’. What we generally call participation in the political process, he makes the distinction between ‘populism’ when plebeians dare to vote in a way that contradicts IYI preferences, and ‘democracy’, when it fits the IYI.

## Chapter 7: Inequality and Skin in the Game

There is inequality and inequality.

The first is the one people tolerate, such as one’s understanding compared to that of people deemed heroes, like Einstein. You may like to imitate them, but you don’t resent them.

The second is the inequality people find intolerable because the subject appears to be just a person like you, except that he’s been playing the system, acquiring privileges that are not warranted. You don’t just envy them; you take umbrage at their fame, and the sight of their expensive or even semi-expensive car triggers some feeling of bitterness.

[Joan C Williams](https://hbr.org/2016/11/what-so-many-people-dont-get-about-the-u-s-working-class) explains that the American working class is impressed by the rich, as role models. Michèle Lamont, in her book [The Dignity of Working Men](https://www.amazon.com/Dignity-Working-Men-Boundaries-Immigration/dp/0674009924?SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&tag=duckduckgo-ffab-es-21&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0674009924), cited by Williams, did a systematic interview of blue-collar Americans and found resentment of high-paid professionals but, unexpectedly, not of the rich.

In countries were wealth comes from rent-seeking, political patronage or regulatory capture, like mine, wealth is seen as a zero-sum game: someone getting rich is doing so at other people’s expense. It is safe to say that the people despises people who make a lot of money on a salary.

What people resent is the person at the top who can't go down. True equality is equality in probability.

### The static and the dynamic

As part of the Scrum methodology, we have a fortnightly demo where we present what we did over the last two weeks to the rest of the company. It's common that some teams may present the number of bugs they have open, and how that number has evolved through time.

While looking at one of those charts, it kept me wondering: "what does this tell me about the time that a bug takes on average to be resolved?" And I found myself realising that it tells nothing about it: one bug may have been there for ages and no one would notice.

It certainly is funny to see that people like Piketty and other social economists don't understand this either. There is a well known economist in a well known newspaper that I read that keeps insisting that inequality has gone down, in the line drawn by Piketty and others. The real question is: __what are my prospects of a better future, or considering me as a family lineage, what are the odds of my offspring to keep on doing better?__ Those are questions that no mainstream economist is addressing.

*Static inequality is a snapshot view of inequality; it does not reflect what will happen to you in the course of your life*.

Dynamic (ergodic) inequality takes into account the entire future and past life.

Ergodic means that the likelihood to be in any economic class is the same for everyone: is the ideal concept of the American dream: for those on the top, it's a matter of someone outsmarting or outworking them to replace them.

Rawl’s veil, discussed in [Fooled by Randomness](https://www.amazon.com/Fooled-Randomness-Hidden-Markets-Incerto/dp/0812975219), assumes that a fair society is the one which you would select if there were some type of a lottery.

*What would be the economical system that you would choose, provided that you don’t know at which stage in the society are you going to fall beforehand*?

The way to make society more equal is by forcing the rich to be subjected to the risk of exiting from the 1%. Or, more mathematically, dynamic equality assumes Markov chain with no absorbing states. Someone can always bounce back from ruin, and someone can always fall back from fuck you money.

The exact opposite of perfect ergodicity is an absorbing state: a person gets rich by some process and then, having arrived, stays rich. And if someone enters the lower middle class, he will never have the chance to exit from it and become rich should he want to.

A straightforward condition is that fencing off immigrants from first class citizenship is immoral, and reduces ergodicity, because those people are unable to climb their way to the top. Nobody thinks of himself as rich, but we are, very. And there is people justified to resent us. No downside for some means no upside for the rest.

### Cobbler envies cobbler

Envy does not originate with the impoverished, concerned with the betterment of their condition, but with the clerical class. People who compare themselves to those richer want to actively dispossessed the rich. As with all communist movements, it is often the bourgeois or clerical classes who are the early adopters of revolutionary theories.

>Envy originates from a New York or Washington, D.C., Ivy-League educated IYI with a sense of entitlement, upset some ‘less smart’ persons are much richer.
>
> -- __ Skin in the Game__

People can frame questions and portray enrichment as theft, as was done before the French Revolution, in which case the blue-collar class would ask, once again, for heads to roll, like the case with [UK Parliament expenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_parliamentary_expenses_scandal).

In the more rural past, envy was rather controlled; wealthy people were not as exposed to other persons of their class. The wealthy stayed within their region, surrounded by people who depended on them, say a lord on his properties. It was in mercantile urban environments that socialising within social classes took place. Hence, they needed to keep up with each other, racing on a treadmill. This is the time where communism is born.

For a rich person isolated from vertical socialising with the poor, the poor become something entirely theoretical, a textbook reference. That is why a politician would say 'Refugees Welcome' without thinking of the consequences of doing so: because immigrants are an abstract term to be resolved, but without my involvement.

The intelligentsia therefore feels entitled to deal with the poor as a construct; one they created. Thus, they become convinced that they know what is best for them. The reaction to 'experts' in populism is a reaction to this.

### Ethics of civil service

When, on leaving office, Barack Obama accepted a sum of more than $40 million to write his memoirs, many people were outraged. I had a rough time explaining that having rich people in a public office is very different from having public people become rich. Again, it is the dynamics that matters.

You don’t become a Jesuit priest because it may help you get hired by Goldman Sachs later.

Currently, most civil servants tend to stay in civil service— except for those in delicate areas that industry controls: the agro-alimentary segment, finance, aerospace. Regulators have an incentive to make rules as complex as possible so their expertise can later be hired at a higher price.

So there is an implicit bribe in public service, what we call [revolving doors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolving_door_(politics)). Companies don’t do it out of a sense of honour: simply, it is necessary to keep the system going and encourage the next guy to play by these rules.

## Chapter 8 - An expert called Lindy

[14 Things Ridiculously Successful People Do Every Day](https://www.entrepreneur.com/slideshow/299699), [What 12 Celebrities did to lose weight fast](http://www.nowloss.com/how-celebrities-lose-weight-fast-keep-it-off.htm), [10 of the Laziest Ways You Can Become Rich](https://www.therichest.com/rich-list/nation/10-of-the-laziest-ways-you-can-become-rich/). There are countless, clickbait-y ways to become rich, slim, and successful, and they are of course minimal changes in your life. The main idea is that "if you are not rich, slim and successful, *is because you don't want to*".

There is an industry of domain-experts telling you what you have to do. Trends, rumours, what success people do... that is nonsense. You're missing the complexities of a given person. *Having close access to ultra-successful people* cannot, in fact, yield any information. What is really going on is you're forming a theory of what people you admire do and create a narrative around that theory by using biased information. Successful philosophers write complex, long and convoluted prhases, but that doesn't mean that for you to become a successful philosopher you would have to write like that.

Who is the real expert, then? Time.

The origin of the term ‘Lindy effect’ can be traced back to Albert Goldman and a 1964 article titled ‘[Lindy’s Law](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qripnmgbnvtyx16/1964-goldman.pdf)’, and was further developed by Benoit Mandelbrot in his book [The Fractal Geometry of Nature](https://www.amazon.com/Fractal-Geometry-Nature-Benoit-Mandelbrot/dp/0716711869?SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&tag=duckduckgo-ffab-es-21&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0716711869). Mandelbrot expressed mathematically that for certain things bounded by the life of the producer, like human promise, future life expectancy is proportional to the past. It is also worth credit J Richard Gott and his ‘Copernical principle for lifetime estimation. Gott came up with the idea in 1969 when stopping at the Berlin Wall and wondering how long it would stand. He postulated that the Copernican principle is applicable in cases where nothing is known; unless there was something special about his visit, this gave a 75% chance that he was seeing the wall after the first quarter of its life.

In probability, time and volatility are the same thing; in the Black Scholes formula, time and volatility, along with the differential between current price and the exercise price, determine the price of the option.

Skin in the game is resisting the test of time. It's worth emphasising that the authors of the articles we mentioned before have, of course, no skin in the game. Change for the sake of change, as we see in architecture, food, or lifestyle, is frequently the oppose of progress. Too high a rate of mutation prevents locking in the benefits of previous changes.

### Peer review

And what is praised is suspicious: in 1983, the computer giant IBM made the front cover of BusinessWeek as the ultimate company. If anything, you should afterwards be shorting the company. Collective praise by journal is at the least, suspicious, and at best, a curse. Prizes are likely to hit you at your peak.

But there is something worse than peer assessment: the bureaucratisation of the activity creates a class of new judges: university administrators, who have no clue what someone is doing except via external signals, yet become the actual arbiters.

These arbiters failed to realise that ‘prestigious’ publications are not ‘Lindy compatible’. Academia has a tendency, when unchecked, to evolve into a ritualistic self-referential publishing game. It's the same in high school; it’s remarkable to see how the cool kids underperform everyone else afterwards.

While academia has turned into an athletic contest, Wittgenstein, the author of [Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus](https://www.amazon.com/Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus-Ludwig-Wittgenstein/dp/0486404455/ref=sr_1_1), held the exact opposite viewpoint: if anything, knowledge is the reverse of an athletic contest.

>In philosophy, the winner of the race is the one who can run slowest. [Or without haste.] Or the one who arrives at the finish line last.
>
> -- __Wittgenstein__

The most convincing statements are those in which one stands to lose, and the most unconvincing ones are those in which one patently tries to enhance one’s status without making a tangible contribution.

Someone with a high public presence who is controversial, like [Jose Mourinho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mourinho), and takes risks for his opinion is less likely to be a bullshit vendor.

### Science is Lindy-compatible

>It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with experiment, it's wrong.

The reason science works isn’t because of the ‘scientific method’, but because an idea will fail if it isn’t useful, and can therefore be vulnerable to the falsification of time. For things to survive, they necessarily have to be good at not dying.

This, as [Jordan Peterson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Ys4tQPRis) noted, also applies to superstitions that have crossed centuries because they led to some protective actions.
