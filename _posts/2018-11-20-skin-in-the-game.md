Knowledge can mean different things to different people. For taxi drivers in London, ['The Knowledge'](https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/taxis-and-private-hire/licensing/learn-the-knowledge-of-london) is the exam that candidates must pass before sitting behind the wheel of one of the famous black cabs and drive quickly through London's complicated road network. It typically takes three to four years, and those who pass it have an encyclopedic knowledge of the streets and places of interest.

Then, in 2005, Google Maps was invented. The question is: 'Is still worth it to pass The Knowledge?'

Consider the following thought experiment: a naive tourist who have never been to London jumps into a cab, and asks for directions to, say, the London Eye. You, an experienced taxi driver, know your ways into the City, but more importantly, have the upper hand: his final destination is only 5 minutes away. Do you take the oblivious tourist there by the longest and most expensive route?

Well, it's risky. It can go well, and you'll earn an extra £20, perhaps £50... provided that you don't get caught. Because if you do get caught, fire rains upon you: you lose your license, and with it, 4 years of your life learning the intricacies of the London tracks goes to waste.

Now let's do the same thing if you are armed with your brand new smartphone, which has Google Maps on it, and you're good to go as a newly hired Uber driver. Same story again, same naive tourist, same silly route that can be diverted into an extra bonus. Do you fall for it?

Of course you do. In the second case, you don't have __skin in the game__.

> Skin in the game is necessary to understand the world. Do not understand it as ‘incentives’, as it is understood in finance. It is about symmetry, like having a share of the harm, paying a penalty if something goes wrong. Having an exposure to the real world, and paying a price for its consequences, good or bad.

The book we are covering today is [Skin in the Game](https://www.amazon.com/Skin-Game-Hidden-Asymmetries-Daily/dp/042528462X), by Nassim Taleb. It's the last book of a collection called *Incerto*, an investigation of opacity, luck, uncertainty, probability, human error, risk, and decision making when you don't understand the world. If this is the first time yo stumble upon Taleb, he is definitely a unique writer, and perhaps is this book, the latest one in the series, the best gateway to the rest of the Incerto books, as it covers and summarises information from the others, leaving going more deeply into any topic as an exercise to the reader. As with any good reading, the author is going down the rabbit hole along with you, and Skin in the Game is, to me, the culmination of a journey that for Taleb started in 2001 with the publication of [Fooled by Randomness](https://www.amazon.com/Fooled-Randomness-Hidden-Markets-Incerto/dp/0812975219).

> To figure out why ethics, moral obligation, and skill cannot be easily separable in real life, consider the following. When you tell someone in a position of responsibility, say your bookkeeper, "I trust you", do you mean that 1) you trust his ethics (he will not divert money to Panama), 2) you trust his accounting precision, or 3) both?

First, skin in the game is bullshit identification and filtering: *In academia there is no difference between academia and the real world; in the real world, there is*.

Second, if you have the rewards, you must also get some of the risks, not let others pay the price of your mistakes. If you inflict risk on others, and they are harmed, you need to pay some price for it: *Don’t tell me what you ‘think’, tell me what’s in your portfolio*.

Third, the book is about how much information one should practically share with others.

Fourth, it is about rationality and the test of time, as in acknowledging the complexity of our world not through models, but through trial and error.
