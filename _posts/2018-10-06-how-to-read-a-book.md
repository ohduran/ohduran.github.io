> Television, radio, and all the sources of amusement and information that surround us in our daily lives are artificial props. They can give us the impression that our minds are active, because we are required to react to stimuli from outside. But the power of those external stimuli to keep us going is limited. They are like drugs. We grow used to them, and we continuously need more and more of them. Eventually, they have little to no effect. Then, if we lack the resources within ourselves, we cease to grow intellectually, morally, and spiritually. And when we cease to grow, we begin to die.

> Reading well, which means reading actively, is thus not only a good in itself, nor it is merely a means to advancement in our work or career. It also serves to keep our minds alive and growing.

We all know how to read; we've all learned in school, and are constantly bombarded by reading material: ads, headlines, emails, blogs, and yes, books. But we haven't really learned __how__ to do it: we just read. We go through life reading but our reading goes through us too. It's something we are [conscious](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-I-quickly-forget-what-I-read) [about](https://mind-globe.com/why-do-i-forget-what-i-read/) [it](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-curse-of-reading-and-forgetting). In most cases, the answer is just "it's OK to forget what you read", but that's paradoxical: if we forget what we read, __why doing it?__

> There is some feeling nowadays that reading is not as necessary as it once was. One of the reasons for this situation is that the very media are so designed as to make thinking seem unnecessary. The packaging of ideas is their production. The viewer of television, the listener to the radio, the reader of magazines, is presented with a whole complex of elements to make it easy for him to ‘make up his own mind’ with the minimum difficulty and effort.

> But the packaging is often done so effectively that the viewer, listener or reader does not make up his own mind at all. Instead, he inserts a packaged opinion into his mind, somewhat like inserting a cassette into a cassette player. He then pushes a button and ‘plays back’ the opinion whenever it seems appropriate to do so. He has performed acceptably without having had to think.

Being literate, that means, being able to read, is an accomplishment that as a society we can be proud of: from a historical perspective, literacy levels for the world population have risen drastically in the last couple of centuries. From only 12% of the people in the world could read and write in 1820, then 42% in 1960 and to 86% in 2015[^1]. We can safely assume that people around us can read too, and so do assume Whatsapp, Facebook and Google.

The problem is definitely not that; in fact, speed reading courses are now widespread, which leads us to believe that a) people are engaged in their reading, b) people want to get through it as fast as they can. Reading is, as the previous quote noted, *not as necessary as it once was*. Unfortunately, this is something that Umberto Eco addressed at some point with the concept of the [antilibrary](https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/03/24/umberto-eco-antilibrary/)

The book I'm talking about today teaches us [How to Read a Book](https://www.amazon.com/How-Read-Book-Intelligent-Touchstone/dp/0671212095?SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&tag=duckduckgo-ffab-es-21&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0671212095): *with nothing but the power of your own mind, you gradually lift yourself from a state of understanding less to one of understanding more*. Its authors are Mortimer Adler and Charles Van Doren. The book argues that, for one to read correctly, he has to go through it in four stages: understanding what is it about, making sense of the terms and propositions of the book, extracting the answers to the questions you want to get answered and contextualise those answers with other books.

This book caught my eye after reading [Deep Work](/2018/08/deep-work). One must not read passively, casually, but rather, actively, engaged. The more you can get from a book, the better. In the shallowness of our lives, Deep Work speaks to a level of deepness in our work that can only be achieved if we extract information from our surroundings the way is described in How to Read a Book. But just being engaged in our reading and not distracted ourselves isn't enough, for there are more barriers to an ideal reading.

> The great majority of the several million books being written in Western tradition will not make sufficient demand on you for you to become a better reader. For the bottom 99% of them, skimming will do.

> There is a second class of books from which you can learn. They are worth reading analytically- once. Such books stretches your mind and increases your understanding.

> Of the few thousand such books, there is a much smaller number that cannot be exhausted by even the very best reading you can manage. You find that you cannot forget the book, that you keep thinking about it and your reaction to it, that you see it everywhere. Finally, you reread it. And two things can happen: you either find there is less than you remember, which means that you outgrew it; or you discover that the book seems to have grown with you.

## Part 1: The dimensions of Reading

The reader is more like the catcher in a game of baseball: ideas cannot be grasped passively, one must fight for them to be hold. Given the same thing to read, one would read it better by reading more actively while carefully executing each step more correctly.

This is where one abandons the idea that he can read already: executing all the necessary steps is tough, and it's embarrassing to put yourself in the beginner's feet. But there is a clever analogy here:

> It is just as true of reading as it is of skiing that you cannot coalesce a lot of different acts into one complex, harmonious performance until you become expert at each of them. Each separate act requires you full attention while you are doing it. After you have practiced the parts separately, you can not only do each with greater facility and less attention, but can also gradually put them together into a smoothly running whole.

### Reading as learning

The Ancient Greeks understood that there is a difference between a sophist and a philosopher: one is only half-way between absolute ignorance and the true knowledge of a philosopher: *[I Know that I Know Nothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_that_I_know_nothing)*. They had a name for such a person with only a small amount of knowledge and a huge amount of ego: *sophomores*.

>To be informed is to know simply that something is the case. To be enlightened is to know, in addition, what it is all about: why it is the case, what its connections are with other facts, in what respects it is the same, in what respects it is different, and so forth.

You cannot learn passively: like the baseball catcher, you either play the game or you don't. In fact, we can draw an analogy between reading and learning from a teacher. Reading isn't effortless, as learning from a  teacher isn't effortless either: *keenness of observation, readily available memory, range of imagination, and of course an intellect trained in analysis and reflection*.
