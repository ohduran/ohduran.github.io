> Television, radio, and all the sources of amusement and information that surround us in our daily lives are artificial props. They can give us the impression that our minds are active, because we are required to react to stimuli from outside. But the power of those external stimuli to keep us going is limited. They are like drugs. We grow used to them, and we continuously need more and more of them. Eventually, they have little to no effect. Then, if we lack the resources within ourselves, we cease to grow intellectually, morally, and spiritually. And when we cease to grow, we begin to die.
