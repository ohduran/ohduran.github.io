> In his book [The Innovators](https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Hackers-Geniuses-Created-Revolution/dp/1476708703), Walter Isaacson summarised Bill Gate's unique tendency toward depth as follows: _The one trait that differentiated [Gates from Allen] was focus. Allen's mind would flit between many ideas and passions, but Gates was a serial obsessor_.

[Deep Work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692) is the *professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit*. The book I'm talking about today drills into what makes deep work valuable, in clear opposition to 'shallow work', which pervades our daily lives. Its author is Cal Newport, also author of [So Good they Can't Ignore You](https://www.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You/dp/1455509124/ref=pd_sim_14_1?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1455509124&pd_rd_r=62e5c976-ac8e-11e8-8742-1712fd196554&pd_rd_w=PYHhw&pd_rd_wg=MWemg&pf_rd_i=desktop-dp-sims&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_p=a180fdfb-b54e-4904-85ba-d852197d6c09&pf_rd_r=XW18WZ7NEDFFTYSAAZDV&pf_rd_s=desktop-dp-sims&pf_rd_t=40701&psc=1&refRID=XW18WZ7NEDFFTYSAAZDV). The book argues that it is the ability to do deep work what sets apart great people like Carl Jung, Mark Twain, Woody Allen, J.K. Rowling, and, of course, Bill Gates, and that *the ubiquity of deep work among influential individuals is important to emphasize because it stands in sharp contrast to the behavior of most modern knowledge workers*.

Like [the Unabomber's manifesto](http://editions-hache.com/essais/pdf/kaczynski2.pdf), this is one of those books that affect the way you look at the world, one of those books that you cannot unread once you go through the last page: the Internet is highly addictive, there is no "I know better", and it's undermining our ability to produce high quality work. 'Deep Work' is *not some nostalgic affectation of writers and early-twentieth-century philosophers*, but an enlightener: take a moment to understand that you're constantly distracted, but so is everyone else.

## Part 1: The Idea
In the first part of the book, the author develops what he calls "The Deep Work Hypothesis": *[T]he ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy*. He dedicates the first part of the book entirely to present arguments that will convince you that this hypothesis is true, like witnesses before the Grand Jury.

The first three witnesses are well known individuals that have achieved success in their work lives: Nate Silver, renowned by his election forecasts and his website [FiveThirtyEight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/); David Heinemeier Hansson, the creator of Ruby on Rails, one of the most famous Web development frameworks, *which currently provides the foundations for some of the Web's most popular destinations, including Twitter and Hulu* (also GitHub, Groupon and AirBnB); and John Doerr, a general partner in a VC firm who *helped fund many of the key companies fuelling the current technological revolution*. These are the three personifications of what the author would call stars of our era, because they embody three ways to achieve success in a world where, as intelligent machine improves, there is little room for those who are just average workers:

- The "high-skilled workers", like Nate Silver, who leverage the development of technologies like data analytics, have seen their more abstract reasoning rise in value over the last couple of years.

- The "superstars", represented by the ace programmer David Heinemeier Hansson, in which the advancement of high-speed data networks and collaboration tools have destroyed regionalism in many sectors of the knowledge work. It no longer makes sense for employers to confine themselves into local talent pool, because experts are just one email away.

The final case is, as always, those who have the money, represented by John Doerr. If quickly amassing capital is not within reach, the author lays down two core abilities for thriving in the New Economy:

1. Quickly master hard things - if you don't learn, you can't thrive.
2. Produce at an elite level in both quality and speed - if you don't produce, you won't thrive.

On the first one, to join the group of those who can work well with complicated topics, *requires that you hone your ability to master hard things*. This process of mastering hard things never ends. And just exposing kids to technology isn't enough: *Giving students iPads or allowing them to film homework assignments on YouTube prepares them for a high-tech economy about as much as playing with Hot Wheels would prepare them to thrive as auto mechanics*.

Now consider producing at elite level: mastering is not enough. You must do something with it. The ability that sets David Hansson apart is not his unique ability to program computers well, but his ability to unambiguously produce valuable and concrete results. Same for Nate Silver: he used to work with many statisticians during his time at Baseball Prospectus, but it was him alone who put the effort to adapt his analytical skills to election forecasting.

And, yes, you guessed, these two core abilities depend on your ability to perform deep work. The author relies on the works of [K. Anders Ericsson](http://projects.ict.usc.edu/itw/gel/EricssonDeliberatePracticePR93.pdf), who claims: *We agree that expert performance is qualitatively different from normal performance and even that expert performers have characteristics and abilities that are qualitatively different from or at least outside the range of those of normal adults. However, we deny that these differences are immutable, that is, due to innate talent. [...] Instead, we argue that the differences between expert performers and normal adults reflect a life-long period of deliberate effort to improve performance*.

Good Will Hunting is pronounced dead: Ericsson's line of research signals that to master a cognitively demanding task requires this specific form of practice, which consists of:

1. Focused attention on a specific skill.
2. Receiving feedback.

The first component is crucial: it emphasises that progress cannot exist alongside distraction, but instead requires uninterrupted concentration. The author mentions the way Adam Grant, a successful professor at Wharton School of Business, is able to produce an absurdly high amount of articles being published in major journals: he batches the important intellectual work into long, uninterrupted stretches, by stacking his teaching in one semester, and turning his attention to research during the rest of the year.

By consolidating his work into intense pulses, he leverages the intensity of focus, as opposed by the average Joe, who is prone to workaholism. The concept of attention residue, the idea that jumping from one task to another is not accompanied by completely focusing on the next task, but having some 'residue' left on the earlier one, helps explain __why intensity is much more important than time when it comes to productivity__.

Deep work is the type of work that optimises your performance.

Instead, organisations like Twitter or Facebook do not optimise for those who can thrive doing deep work. Jack Dorsey is the notable case. He represents a bunch of people who thrive in building successful companies and do not have the luxury of long periods of uninterrupted thinking.

In fact, they help explain why deep work is so rare in our society: they are the decision makers and, although most of the value of technology companies is produced by those who perform some form of deep work, manager's work is scattered in meetings, small talks and catch ups over the water cooler. Their work is shallow, and they make decisions around that mindset.

That's why Facebook unveiled in 2012 the plans for a new headquarters with "the largest open floor plan in the world", and why IBM's managers estimate that its employees send around 2.5 million instant messages each day.

Let's disabuse ourselves from the idea that managers are evil people who go for open offices because they find a weird sense of amusement in our incapacity to focus: they choose open offices because those are the sort of offices that are optimal for them. Same goes for working from home and any other kind of innovation in terms of working environment: if it's not optimal for the decision makers, it's simply not going to happen. The __real__ reason why managers can't let their employees do deep work is that control-freak mindset is still celebrated and encouraged among managers.

> "To do real good physics work, you do need absolute solid lengths of time... it needs a lot of concentration... if you have a job administrating anything, you don't have the time. So I have invented another myth for myself: that I'm irresponsible. I tell everyone I don't do anything. If anyone asks me to be on a committee for admissions, 'no', I tell them: 'I'm irresponsible".

The author ends this section talking about the work of Csikszentmihalyi (whom we have spoken about [before](/2018/08/the-delights-of-science)). His research helped validate the theory that *the best moments [in life] usually occur when a person's body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile*. Csikszentmihalyi calls this mental state __flow__, against the common assumption that relaxation is what makes people happy.

Deep work is an activity well suited to generate a flow state.
