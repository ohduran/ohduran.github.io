This is the end game. We have discussed language several times now: [How to Read a Book](/how-to-read-a-book) showed us how conversations can happen at different levels because we haven't agreed what words mean before our conversation started; we discussed the implications of human language in Wittgenstein's [Tractatus](/tractatus-logico-philosophicus), and how what is real and tangible can be described, but what is metaphysical is groundless and must be avoided. We covered the interaction between how we think and how we speak in [Through the Language Glass](/through-the-language-glass) and [Politics and the English Language](/politics-and-the-english-language), and found some time to cover Chomsky's main thesis in [The Architecture of Language](/the-architecture-of-language).

It's time we grow in ourselves some [skin in the game](/skin-in-the-game): how would a wise man talk his way out of a trial for his life?

You wouldn't be able to test that in court nowadays. Advanced civilisation has come up with a set of rituals that aim at making truth reveal itself on witness testimonies and cross examinations and overruled and sustained objections. There is no room left for an eager amateur to find an unconventional route: since the Roman Republic, all the paths have been explored. Like [Shakelton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Shackleton), we live in a world that has already moved on from exploratory expeditions.

If we are to find guidelines on laymen talking their way out of capital sentence, we need to go back to when democracy was in its infancy: the trial of Socrates is our perfect *petri dish*.

Democracy wasn't born out of the blue. Before the first attempt at democratic government, Athens was ruled by the local aristocracy, the archons, but the feuding among them have had brought an unbearable burden to the rest of the Athenians. In the 6th century BC, Solon, premier archon at the time, liberated the Athenian labouring class and halt the feuding.

> Some wicked men are rich, some good are poor;
>
> We will not change our virtue for their store:
>
> Virtue's a thing that none can take away,
>
> But money changes owners all the day.

> -- __Solon__


Solon issued reforms to define citizenship in a way that gave a greater amount of people the right to participate in assembly meetings. Thus, the ability to articulate opinions in a convincing manner turned overnight into a powerful skill. The increasingly wealthy city of Athens, who led what came to be known as the [Delian League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delian_League), attracted a class of intellectuals who taught courses in various subjects, speculated about the nature of language and culture and employed rhetoric to achieve their purposes: the sophists. Protagoras, Gorgias, Prodicus... a set of professionals of the eloquence came to Athens and shaped the infant democracy, and focused the debate on the topic of truth and morality.

Can a guilty person exercise his rhetorical skills to be found non guilty in court? Are the laws ensuring a harmonious society?

These sophists claimed that they could find the answers to all questions, and convince anyone of anything. Many sophists taught their skills for a price, and due to the importance of such skills in the litigious social life of Athens, practitioners often commanded very high fees. And although the word 'sophist' has nowadays a connotation of deceit, this connotation comes from the hostile attitude that Plato had towards them. A relative of Solon, Plato had witnessed how his ancestor's good intentions had been perverted by this class of professionals of the eloquence. He joined the ranks of a competitive group, who, against the pretentious of the sophists, who 'knew all', seek humbly to know more, because they 'knew nothing'. These were the philosophers, and Socrates was the first of his kind. For the general population though, they were two sides of the same coin.

The fact that the sophists questioned the existence and roles of traditional deities, and proposed alternative explanations for natural phenomena prompted a popular reaction against them. The *zeitgeist* of this reaction can be found in [The Clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clouds). In 'The Clouds', Socrates is a character depicted as a petty thief, at worst, and a foolish man to take pity on, at worst.

> STREPSIADES: Really? Please tell me how.
>
> PUPIL: He was studying the tracks of the lunar orbit / and its revolutions, and as he skyward gaped, / from the roof in darkness a lizard shat on him.

While all of this was happening, the city of Athens as a whole and its imperialistic behaviour towards other members of the Delian League led to tensions. Eventually, the Peloponnesian War broke out after clashing against Sparta. Athens was humiliated, and the commander of the army, Alcibiades, took most of the blame. With it, public animosity was fuelled towards any of Alcibiades' associates, like Socrates.

He was in the midst of public defamation, the backlash at arrogant sophists, and blamed for a traumatic war defeat. It's the decay of Greek democracy, and those who represent it are going to be punished for it.

## Euthyphro

> EUTHYPHRO: Why have you left the Lyceum, Socrates? and what are you doing in the porch of the King Archon? Surely you can not be engaged in an action before the king, as I am.
>
> SOCRATES: Not in an action, Euthyphro; impeachment is the word which the Athenians use.
>
> -- __Trial and Death of Socrates__

This is where our story begins. In the first of the four dialogues, Socrates bumps into Euthyphro, near the court of the *archon basileus* (king magistrate); each man is present at the court for the preliminary hearings to possible trials. It's where we are presented what is Socrates accused of.

> SOCRATES: [My accuser] says he knows how the youth are corrupted and who are their corruptors. I fancy that he must be a wise man, and seeing that I am anything but a wise man, he has found me out, and is going to accuse me of corrupting his young friends.
>
> [...] He says that I am a poet or maker of gods, and that I make new gods and deny the existence of old ones; this is the ground of his indictment.
>
> -- __Trial and Death of Socrates__

Sophists are eloquent, and perhaps took their eloquence too far. Denying the existence of gods wasn't just heresy, it was illegal, and people who questioned everything and everyone were tying their fate to the democratic right to question everything. It was a matter of time before the spearhead of rhetoric, the inventor of the socratic dialogue, was made scapegoat of the humiliation of Athens.

And socratic dialogue is what we have in this first section: Socrates is a master of it, and he challenges Euthyphro to define what is piety, stretching the extent of his underlying assumptions up to a point where he eventually gives up. Socrates is a wise man, but under the eloquence and the depth of his reasoning you can find the irony, the arrogance, the vanity. Like in many other works by Plato, Socrates does all the conversation heavy lifting; Euthyphro is left with just agreeing here and there to everything he says. It's just too easy.

He is overwhelmingly smart. He can triumph over any argument, because he clinch onto the idea that no one knows anything for sure. But in doing so, he forgets about basic human nature: people get pissed off.

> SOCRATES: Then we must begin again and ask, What is piety?
>
> EUTHYPHRO: Another time, Socrates; for I am in a hurry, and must go now.
>
> -- __Trial and Death of Socrates__

If this is the opening of anything, the terms are clear: he's going to win the argument, but he isn't going to win the jury. The fact that it all boils down to a jury of 500 men, as it was the norm, is going to work against him.

## Apology

> How you have felt, Oh men of Athens, at hearing the speeches of my accusers, I cannot tell; but I know that their persuasive words almost made me forget who I was: â€” such was the effect of them; and yet they have hardly spoken a word of truth.
>
> -- __Trial and Death of Socrates__

This second section, called the Apology, is one of many explanatory *apologia* about Socrates's legal defence. Although Aristotle later classified it as a genre of fiction, it is still a useful historical source about Socrates.
