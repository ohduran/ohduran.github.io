Happy New Year!

As you might have noticed, I have completely rebuilt the whole site, which is now perfectly designed for mobile and laptop. After a while, I've noticed that the whole bootstrap site that I came to build couldn't keep up with the changes I'm planning on doing on the site, so I needed something fresh. And this is the result!

It's the perfect way to say welcome to 2019 and hope for the best to all.

I've made use of a template by the guys at [CloudCannon](http://cloudcannon.com/), who of course deserve a shootout for saving me the time to start from scratch again.

Let me know what you think and see you around!
