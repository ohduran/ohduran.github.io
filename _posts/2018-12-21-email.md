I'm no different from you: I get a lot of email. Managing my attention means I have to separate the wheat from the chaff (look it up), so that I can be influenced by solid ideas instead of falling prey to foolish fads.

Effectively, it all comes down to who sent it, and what they wrote on the subject line. So, if I didn't answer your email, it's probably not personal: I glanced at it, and piled it on the "Later", and later can span from 1 second from now to eternity.
