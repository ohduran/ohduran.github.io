I'm not different from you: I get a lot of email. [Managing my attention](/deep-work) means I have to separate the wheat from the chaff (look it up). Effectively, it all comes down to who sent the email, and what did they write on the subject line.

So, if I didn't answer your email, it's probably not personal: It took a while for me to see it, since I have no notifications for my emails, and when I saw it I mentally tagged it as 'Later' in my head after skimming its content for a couple of seconds.

In any case, what I expect from someone who values my time as much as theirs is a well crafted email that has the structure of a hand written letter.
