A couple of days ago, I bumped into a rant by an anonymous guy who bantered something like this:

>In 2015, I left my stable job and a six-figure salary, dropping down to less than a quarter of what I was on. I rented out my apartment, moved into a share-house and sold my BMW.

>I worked 16-hour days, 7 days a week for over a year. This was to follow a burning passion and it was the best decision I’ve ever made. >[...] I followed my dream to start my own company [...] It has gone from strength to strength.
>
>If you feel a burning desire to create change, 100% I say take the risk. I did, and it’s been the best decision of my life.

I guess you have run into that sort of posts too. You might even have had the feeling that you are missing out on something really special, and the desire to quit your job is burning. Hell, he did succeed, and so can I!

But what if you bumped into a post like the following:

>In 2015, I left my stable job and a six-figure salary, dropping down to less than a quarter of what I was on. 
>
>And I used all that money on gambling.
>
>I relentlessly completed lots and lots of lottery tickets. I played in a casino 16-hour days, 7 days a week for over a year. I followed my >guts and fell into my greatest addiction. And one day, I made $20'000'000!!
>
>If you feel a burning desire to gamble, 100% I say take the risk. I did, and it’s been the best decision of my life.


Pretty much the same rant, with the obvious change of "build my own company" to "gamble furiously". The idea that someone made a lot of money on the lottery doesn't get you any closer to buy into it and start playing cards. That's because you understand that making millions out of gambling is an anecdote, not a common outcome. In fact, it's quite rare - that's obviously the whole point.

But why on Earth would you pay attention to the first post?[1]

In both cases, the writer falls into what is called survivorship bias. Facing an uncertain situation and falling on your feet doesn't make it less riskier. It's only your perception of risk that has changed. And that makes all the difference, because a risky path has been rewarded, and thus it's likely to be taken again, regardless of the actual chance of making it right again[2].

Financial analyst do that too on their reporting. Here's how:

- Take information on companies from the S&P 500.
- Collect information about a certain topic (most are valid here, like how many of them raised cash dividends when their stock price goes up, something like that).
- Publish your report and... there, you did it.

So easily, you fell into the trap. Have you considered all those companies that used to be on S&P, but aren't there anymore? Is that information not taking into account relevant? (hint: it is)

So, yes: next time you think of your chances of success doing something, look around. Sometimes it's just pure luck what got some people to the top.[3] And even if you decide to go ahead, and in some cases it's fine, be aware of what you have for you, and what you have against.

Rule #1: Don't be a fool.





[1] No one posted a comment on this topic. The most common answers were about what the company was about (won't share to avoid any direct or indirect diffamation of the person who wrote this), or something like "Great post, life is too short to settle!".

[2] That's indeed what is so addictive about gambling: the unlikely reward, usually tied to a false sense of expertise or edge, like "dices are hot", and "I'm in the zone". Cities like Las Vegas have been built on top of those fools.

[3] On a personal note, I truly believe that everyone in the stock market has succeeded because of pure luck. They probably tell you other story.
