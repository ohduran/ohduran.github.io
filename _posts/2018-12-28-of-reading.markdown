It's likely that the Middle Age came to an end not because Cristopher Columbus discovered a new continent, but because Gutenberg found a way to make books cheaper by introducing the printing press. This was a crucial achievement that paved the way to a new era, by becoming something that [the society took from granted ever since](/revolutions). Luther became famous for posting his [Ninety-five Theses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-five_Theses), but his true achievement was paving the way for alternative interpretations of the Bible: read it yourself, and then think about it.

That can happen only if books are available to people outside a monastery. Reading allowed our society to spread learning much faster than the old apprenticeship system: talent became scalable.

But perhaps widespread reading has had secondary effects that Gutenberg wasn't expecting. If wise people read, then someone who wants to follow their example must read too. In fact, being taught nowadays, from a very young age, that reading as much as possible is the pathway to success is a very common thing. [Bill Gates claims to read 50 books a year](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/04/fashion/bill-gates-gates-notes-books.html), crystallising the now widespread idea that most CEOs read one book per week.

That, of course, is mental: no CEO maintains a one-book-a-week pace by reading carefully while neglecting his obligations, but by making shortcuts like listening to the audiobook version on Overcast at 10x speed. This race to the quantity of books has come at the expense of the quality, because reading these days is all about words per minute. People search for [Viagra for the Brain](https://www.google.com/search?q=viagra+for+the+brain) because becoming wiser is something that takes too long, and we [despise wasting time](/of-wasted-time).

> The writer Umberto Eco belongs to that small class of scholars who are encyclopedic, insightful, and nondull. He is the owner of a large personal library (containing thirty thousand books), and separates visitors into two categories: those who react with “Wow! Signore professore dottore Eco, what a library you have! How many of these books have you read?” and the others — a very small minority — who get the point that a private library is not an ego-boosting appendage but a research tool.

If you want to learn, you have to read. But *reading* is not stepping on letters to get across like [Indiana Jones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxPdqbmYi8U#t=1m28s). For one to really __read__, he has to go through it in four stages, as we discussed in [How to Read a Book](/how-to-read-a-book): understanding what the book is about, making sense of its terms and propositions, extracting the answers to the questions you want to get answered and contextualise those answers with other books. This takes time, and if you are reading books that are challenging, then it takes longer than one week.

Reading is done actively: take notes, lots of them. For instance, I take notes about the book I'm reading even when I'm not reading it: something might occur to me while working, or maybe I'm having a conversation with someone that overlaps with something I learnt on that book. Everything gets jotted down.

Book notes are, hence, not just highlights on the Kindle, but a collection of thoughts on the whole book, an attempt at rewriting it my way, and on my terms. I've seen book notes all over the Internet from people I admire and that in itself is good news, but they belong to the first level of reading, and that for me is not enough.

I understand that the race to have 200+ book notes is powerful, and even more powerful is stating something like 'I've read all these books, but don't take my word for it, check out the notes I wrote'.

So it looks to me that the race is still to quantity, after all: Unless you're the one producing those notes, you won't get anything out of reading them.

Putting together highlights and thoughts isn't enough, I reckon. Context is what makes them rememberable. That's why people can't remember telephone numbers, but they always remember how they passed their driver license exam.

So the next point for me worth considering is why bothering in writing those notes after reading a book, which is fair considering that reading a book trumps reading every summary on it. However, this question assumes that reading ends once you turn the last page, which I don't think is true: if done right, a book is never completely read, but something you always come back to, either remembering it or revisiting it. Writing about it becomes part of the process of reading. After all, the value of our writing comes from what it leaves in our minds.

Reading, then writing, makes perfect sense. It extends your memory, because you can write more than what you can remember; it facilitates playing around with ideas by editing; and it clarifies your thinking by crossing out suboptimal lines. I visited [an exhibition on Leonardo da Vinci in Madrid](https://www.losrostrosdelgenio.com/) and the most remarkable thing about Leonardo's notes were that he never intended to publish them: he was supposed to be the sole reader.

If this is about who stands on whom, then of course you must keep your head standing on your own shoulders: writing feeds your reading, and vice versa.

For all I know, that means that I write about what I read, but what should I read about? History? Philosophy? Batman?

Again, there isn't a passive way to look at it. If I want to *learn* about something, I read about it, and I do some research on what could be the best books about what I want to learn. Say I want to learn about [language](/reading), I start with a book about books, and I go from there. Meandering is OK; after all, you're paving the way that only you are going to walk.

But it's hard; when you start reading about a topic, it's all senseless names.

> Names are like points; propositions like arrows: they have sense.
>
> -- __Ludwig Wittgenstein__

The more you learn, though, the more sense everything makes. It's like putting together a jigsaw puzzle: at first, it's all pointless pieces, but they can be assembled to produce a complete picture.

To do so mentally, I tend to ask what I know so far about something, and then I add 'is that right?' at the end. It's a way to collect feedback.

But whom do I get answers from? Well, from the book itself! You're on a quest to put together a corpus of knowledge that is as close to reality as possible, and that means that it *has to make sense*. Exposing your thoughts and ideas, meaning putting their [skin in the game](/skin-in-the-game), is what makes them valuable, robust.

Afterwards, you must focus on those parts that do not make sense. For instance, you can ask questions like 'Are Trump voters racists?'. And realise that it's statistically improbable: they're simply too many; [some must have voted Obama in 2012](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/upshot/how-did-trump-win-over-so-many-obama-voters.html). So the model of reality that considers all Trump voters racists is probably wrong. You need to be humble enough to acknowledge when your models of reality are wrong, because the easiest person to fool is yourself.

Have a map of the books that you want to read, and follow it. If you like reading, then you're going to be bombarded with reading lists that of course are other people's; it's up to you to decide whether these recommendations make sense in the grand scheme of things, and whether they get you closer to where you want to go. Decide whether you want to read the books you're recommended, and be conscious about your goals.

If you find this exercise hard it's because it is. Reading for the purpose of entertaining is what most people do. To read for the purpose of learning you need to be extremely focused, you need to perform [Deep Work](/deep-work).

I've found that thinking is usually the hardest part. Getting to write down the essay once you've put together your notes is usually easy. What [Deep Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)) and [AlphaGo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol) have taught us about chess and Go is that they're less creative games than we thought they were: in essence, they're about remembering all games being played in history, and gauging how many successful scenarios each move gets us closer to. Humans play using the same algorithm; we simply have less data in memory at our disposal. Coming up with the games of chess and Go, however, it's something inherently human, the one that really requires thinking.

Learning how to read is in itself a great skill to have. Most people wander through books like tourists in a museum: they rush from picture to picture recklessly, and they take pictures that they will never look at later. Reading this way is pausing in each painting, looking at it closely. You will probably 'see' less, but you'll certainly understand more.
