Everyone has looked up to the sky and asked the Big Questions. Why are we here, what's our purpose, what's the meaning of life. The fact that those questions have remained unanswered for all history is a testament that they are either impossible to answer, or that we have been framing them wrong all along. In this context, Ludwig Wittgenstein publishes the [Tractatus](https://www.amazon.com/Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus-Ludwig-Wittgenstein/dp/1602064512), to identify the relationship between language and reality and to define the limits of science. Its title is a homage to the [Tractatus Theologico-Politicus](https://www.amazon.com/Theologico-Political-Treatise-Tractatus-Theologico-Politicus-Translated-Contents-ebook/dp/B006LG24I8/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1543868621&sr=1-1&keywords=tractatus+spinoza) by Baruch Spinoza.

The book is cryptic. That's not just me; and even the author himself, in a letter to Bertrand Russell, agrees.

> I’ve written a book called “Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung” containing all my work of the last six years. I believe I’ve solved our problems finally. This may sound arrogant but I can’t help believing it [...] [O]f course [...] nobody will understand it; although I believe, it’s all as clear as crystal.

Two features make the Tractatus challenging. First, the format; [see it for yourself](http://www.tractatuslogico-philosophicus.com/): 7 propositions that are explained by nested clauses that link back to the parent like a bushy tree. The second difficulty for the reader is an apparent dissonance within the book itself; after appearing to put forward logical, linguistic and meta-philosophical theories in the body of the text, the author writes:

> My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them. (He must so to speak throw away the ladder, after he has climbed up on it.) He must transcend these propositions, and then he will see the world aright.

Essentially, the book has, all at once, the resemblance of a mathematical proof and the language of a parable, with the added characteristic that the author aimed at confusion the hell out of the reader.
