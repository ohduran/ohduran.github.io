Everyone has looked up to the sky and asked The Big Questions: why are we here, what's our purpose, what's the meaning of life. The fact that those questions have remained unanswered for all history is a testament that they are either impossible to answer, or that we have been framing them wrong all along. In this context, Ludwig Wittgenstein publishes the [Tractatus](https://www.amazon.com/Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus-Ludwig-Wittgenstein/dp/1602064512), to identify the relationship between language and reality and to define the limits of science. Its title is a homage to the [Tractatus Theologico-Politicus](https://www.amazon.com/Theologico-Political-Treatise-Tractatus-Theologico-Politicus-Translated-Contents-ebook/dp/B006LG24I8/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1543868621&sr=1-1&keywords=tractatus+spinoza) by Baruch Spinoza.

The book is cryptic. That's not just me; even the author himself, in a letter to Bertrand Russell, agrees.

> I’ve written a book called “Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung” containing all my work of the last six years. I believe I’ve solved our problems finally. This may sound arrogant but I can’t help believing it [...] [O]f course [...] nobody will understand it; although I believe, it’s all as clear as crystal.

Two features make the Tractatus challenging. First, [its format](http://www.tractatuslogico-philosophicus.com/): 7 propositions that are explained by nested clauses that link back to the parent like a bushy tree. The second difficulty for the reader is an apparent dissonance within the book itself; after appearing to put forward logical, linguistic and meta-philosophical theories in the body of the text, the author writes:

> My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them. (He must so to speak throw away the ladder, after he has climbed up on it.) He must transcend these propositions, and then he will see the world aright.

Essentially, the book has, all at once, the resemblance of a mathematical proof and the language of a parable, with the added feature that the author aimed at confusing the hell out of the reader.

The book is obscure and fascinating. There is something intriguing about it that reminded me when I was attending a lecture on Calculus at university, and we were learning about the [Cauchy's concept of limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(%CE%B5,_%CE%B4)-definition_of_limit) for the first time:

> $${\displaystyle \lim_{x\to c}f(x)=L\iff (\forall \varepsilon >0,\,\exists \ \delta >0,\,\forall x\in D,\,0<|x-c|<\delta \ \Rightarrow \ |f(x)-L|<\varepsilon )}$$

Talking about cryptic. But once it clicks, and it just happens, my Calculus professor said, it all make sense. You just need to keep going, internalise what you already understand, and let the rest settle. Just like in [How to read a book](/how-to-read-a-book): *Don't pay attention to your literature teachers: read. Read it at one sitting, without stopping to look up weird words, or ponder what you don't understand right away. You'll have a much better chance of understanding it when you're done*.

Of course, I didn't understand the book the first time I read it. But that's because reading, as we learned in [How to Read a Book](/how-to-read-a-book), doesn't end there. I'm still reading it now, by writing.

## Introduction by Betrand Russell

Let's go over the introduction to see how much can we get out of the book before even reading it, but by looking at how Mr Russell summarised its key ideas:

> Wittgenstein is concerned with the conditions for a logically perfect language, [...] the whole function of a language is to have meaning, and it only fulfils that function in proportion as it approaches to the conditions of an ideal language.
>
> -- __Betrand Russell__

In practice, language is always more or less vague; what we assert is never quite precise. Thus, logic has two problems.

1. The conditions for sense rather than nonsense when combining symbols.
2. The conditions for uniqueness of meaning or reference in symbols or their combination.

> Two people can be using the same word, meaning different things, yet continue the conversation. That's fine for coffee, but not when making decisions.

The first requisite for an ideal language would be that there should be one name for every concept, and never the same name for two different concept. Of course, your daily used English doesn't operate that way: it has evolved to be useful, not to be accurate. It's, like Taleb would say, "Lindy compatible". And if that annoys you, be aware that your eyes have evolved pretty much in the same way: optical illusions are a consequence of that.

No, your language isn't ideal, in the sense that Russell is conveying. English, like any other language on Earth, has focused on a tiny subset of concepts that are easy to memorise, easy to apply, and possibly easy to reuse in different context. That's why 'easy' in the previous sentence was applied to each action, although it meant not quite the same thing in each case: to provide both a more approachable context for you to understand the sentence, and to give musicality to the whole so that it sticks.

In a logically perfect language, however, nothing that is not simple will have a simple symbol, but a complex containing the symbols for the parts.
