Everyone has looked up to the sky and asked The Big Questions: why are we here, what's our purpose, what's the meaning of life. The fact that those questions have remained unanswered for all history is a testament that they are either impossible to answer, or that we have been framing them wrong all along. In this context, Ludwig Wittgenstein publishes the [Tractatus](https://www.amazon.com/Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus-Ludwig-Wittgenstein/dp/1602064512), to identify the relationship between language and reality and to define the limits of science. Its title is a homage to the [Tractatus Theologico-Politicus](https://www.amazon.com/Theologico-Political-Treatise-Tractatus-Theologico-Politicus-Translated-Contents-ebook/dp/B006LG24I8/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1543868621&sr=1-1&keywords=tractatus+spinoza) by Baruch Spinoza.

The book is cryptic. That's not just me; even the author himself, in a letter to Bertrand Russell, agrees.

> I’ve written a book called “Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung” containing all my work of the last six years. I believe I’ve solved our problems finally. This may sound arrogant but I can’t help believing it [...] [O]f course [...] nobody will understand it; although I believe, it’s all as clear as crystal.

> Wittgenstein, in a letter to Russell, March 1919

Two features make the Tractatus challenging. First, [its format](http://www.tractatuslogico-philosophicus.com/): 7 propositions that are explained by nested clauses that link back to the parent like a bushy tree. The second difficulty for the reader is an apparent dissonance within the book itself; after appearing to put forward logical, linguistic and meta-philosophical theories in the body of the text, the author writes:

> My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them. (He must so to speak throw away the ladder, after he has climbed up on it.) He must transcend these propositions, and then he will see the world aright.

> -- __Tractatus__

Essentially, the book has, all at once, the resemblance of a mathematical proof and the language of a parable, with the added feature that the author aimed at confusing the hell out of the reader.

The book is obscure and fascinating. There is something intriguing about it that reminded me when I was attending a lecture on Calculus at university, and we were learning about the [Cauchy's concept of limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(%CE%B5,_%CE%B4)-definition_of_limit) for the first time:

> $${\displaystyle \lim_{x\to c}f(x)=L\iff (\forall \varepsilon >0,\,\exists \ \delta >0,\,\forall x\in D,\,0<|x-c|<\delta \ \Rightarrow \ |f(x)-L|<\varepsilon )}$$

Talking about cryptic. But once it clicks, and it just happens, my Calculus professor said, it all make sense. You just need to keep going, internalise what you already understand, and let the rest settle. Just like in [How to read a book](/how-to-read-a-book): *Don't pay attention to your literature teachers: read. Read it at one sitting, without stopping to look up weird words, or ponder what you don't understand right away. You'll have a much better chance of understanding it when you're done*.

Of course, I didn't understand the book the first time I read it. But that's because reading, as we learned in [How to Read a Book](/how-to-read-a-book), doesn't end there. I'm still reading it now, by writing.

## Introduction by Betrand Russell

Let's go over the introduction to see how much can we get out of the book before even reading it, just by looking at how Mr Russell summarised its key ideas:

> Wittgenstein is concerned with the conditions for a logically perfect language, [...] the whole function of a language is to have meaning, and it only fulfils that function in proportion as it approaches to the conditions of an ideal language.
>
> -- __Betrand Russell__

In practice, language is always more or less vague; what we assert is never quite precise. Thus, logic has two problems.

1. The conditions for sense rather than nonsense when combining symbols.
2. The conditions for uniqueness of meaning or reference in symbols or their combination.

> Two people can be using the same word, meaning different things, yet continue the conversation. That's fine for coffee, but not when making decisions.
>
> -- __[Skin in the Game](skin-in-the-game)__

The first requisite for an ideal language would be that there should be one name for every concept, and never the same name for two different concept. Of course, your daily used English doesn't operate that way: it has evolved to be useful, not to be accurate. It's, like Taleb would say, "Lindy compatible". And if that annoys you, be aware that your eyes have evolved pretty much in the same way: optical illusions are a consequence of that.

No, your language isn't ideal, in the sense that Russell is conveying. English, like any other language on Earth, has focused on a tiny subset of concepts that are easy to memorise, easy to apply, and possibly easy to reuse in different context. That's why 'easy' in the previous sentence was applied to each action, although it meant not quite the same thing in each case: to provide both a more approachable context for you to understand the sentence, and to give musicality to the whole so that it sticks.

In a logically perfect language, however, nothing that is not simple will have a simple symbol, but a complex containing the symbols for the parts. Thus, words like 'moral', 'beauty', 'rightfulness' contain an inference of what the speaker thinks those words mean, which indeed causes reasoning about them to be self-referential and, thus, a useless tautology. Most questions and propositions of the philosophers result from the fact that we do not understand the logic of our language.

> [Wittgenstein] compares linguistic expressions to projections in Geometry. A geometrical figure may be projected in many ways, each of them corresponding to a different language, but the projective properties of the original figure remain unchanged regardless of these ways may be adopted. [...] The gramophone record, the musical thought, the score, the waves of sound, all stand to one another in that pictorical internal relation which holds between language and the world. To all of them the logical structure is common, and they are all in certain sense one.

"We make ourselves pictures of facts" is indeed the catchy phrase encapsulating this. That we are not looking at the world, but instead we are modelling it by means of our own language, as it is the way we process thoughts. Because what cannot be thought, cannot be said. __The object of philosophy should be the clarification of those thoughts__, not to make a certain number of 'philosophical propositions'.

The world consists of facts; which cannot be directly said, but are what make propositions true or false. If we can reduce the world to a set of simple, or atomic, facts, independent to each other like a canonic base of vectors, then we can fully describe the world, so long as those are all of them. It's like the 5 axioms of Euclides' [Elements of Geometry](https://www.amazon.com/Euclids-Elements-Geometry-Classic-Reprint/dp/B008HV6DXC), the building blocks of the whole corpus of the book.

We can also extend the analogy by saying that, once we have a uniform method of construction of propositions as truth functions that are born from propositions that declare those atomic facts, logic can be defined as the corpus that results from that set of atomic propositions, in the same way that Geometry follows from Euclides' 5 axioms and Electromagnetism follows from Maxwell's equations. Even the fact that Newtonian mechanics does not hold logically from Maxwell's equations prompted Einstein to look at the world from a different angle, and eventually came up with special relativity.

> It is known that Maxwell's electrodynamics—as usually understood at the present time—when applied to moving bodies, leads to asymmetries which do not appear to be inherent in the phenomena. [...] [It] suggests that the phenomena of electrodynamics as well as of mechanics possess no properties corresponding to the idea of absolute rest. They suggest rather that, as has already been shown to the first order of small quantities, the same laws of electrodynamics and optics will be valid for all frames of reference for which the equations of mechanics hold good.

But using group theory on logic also brings its problems with it. Gödel's paradox, which we also introduced in [Skin in the Game](/skin-in-the-game), can be reduced to "groups cannot speak about themselves". Given that logic is how we see the world, it cannot contain whether the world exists or not: that would lead to absurdities. Therefore, logic restrains the possibilities of the world, but not what does exist in the world.

That the world is my world appears in the fact that the boundaries of language indicates the boundaries of my world. The fact that there is no word in English for certain things such as *sonder*, the Finnish word for the feeling you get when you realise that the strangers you are surrounded by on the street have lives as deep as yours, is related to the fact that most non-Finnish people haven’t realised that; giving names to certain aspects of our lives sheds light to them.

But what about belief? In all cases related to belief (doubt, consider, desire, etc), it seems natural to say *A doubts p*, which makes it appear as though we were dealing with a relation between a person and a proposition. But the proposition is not about whether what is believed is true or false, but about whether the person believes or not what he or she claims to believe.

Wittgenstein’s attitude towards the mystical grows naturally out of his doctrine. The logical proposition is a picture of the fact, and has in common with the fact a certain structure. This structure is what makes it capable of being a picture of the fact, but the structure cannot be put into words. Think of the word 'fridge', short of 'refrigerator'. It conveys the sense of cold, and that sense is complemented by its translation into German ('*Kühlschrank*', literally 'cold closet'), and Spanish ('*nevera*', which comes from *nieve*, 'snow', which was the main component of the fridge when it was invented). Everything, therefore, involved in the very idea of the expressiveness of a language must remain incapable of being expressed in language, as it is inexpressive in a perfectly __precise sense__.

> The right method of teaching philosophy would be to confine oneself to propositions of the sciences, stated with all possible clearness and exactness, leaving philosophical assertions to the learner, and proving to him that they are meaningless.

## 1 - The World is all that is the case

Let's now jump into the book itself. As we discussed, the book follows an schematic format, with 7 main propositions that branch out. See the first proposition branching out for yourself:


    1 The world is all that is the case.

       1.1 The world is the totality of facts, not of things.

            1.1.1 The world is determined by the facts, and by their being all the facts.

            1.1.2 For the totality of facts determines what is the case, and also whatever is not the case.

            1.1.3 The facts in logical space are the world.

       1.2 The world divides into facts.

            1.2.1 Each item can be the case or not the case while everything else remains the same.

What the author is conveying here is that we shouldn't be concerned with things, because they cannot be communicated. To us, the world consists of things we can communicate to each other and to ourselves (think), that's why the world consists of facts.

## 2 - What is the case (a fact) is the existence of state of affairs.

A state of affairs is a combination of objects. It’s the state of things. If things can occur in states of affairs, this possibility must be in them from the beginning: special relativity is contained in Maxwell’s equations. Things are, then, independent from each other, but connected with states of affairs, the logical framework of the world they belong to: a speck in the visual field must have colour, a musical note must have a pitch, and so on. Their independence also means that it's impossible for words to appear in two different roles.

Each object is in a space of possible states of affairs. They make up the substance of the world, and if they had no substance, then whether a proposition had sense would depend on whether another proposition is true. In that case, we couldn’t sketch any picture of the world. This is more or less what Descartes proposed: *[cogito ergo sum*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum). An imagined world, however different, must have something in common with ours (how weird would be watching a movie that cannot be described?). However, it’s only by means of propositions that material properties are represented: objects are colourless.

And in the same way, we don't compare objects, but properties. If there is nothing to distinguish a thing, I cannot do it, because I cannot indicate what is different. Reality is only reachable through our senses; it is perceived by a subject, not something that’s there.

In a state of affairs, objects fit into one another like links of a chain: they stand in a determined relation to one another, which is the structure of the state of affairs: form is the possibility of structure.

The totality of existing states of affairs is the world, and determine those that do not exist. That is reality.

## 2.1 -  We picture facts to ourselves.
