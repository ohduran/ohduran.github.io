<p>I'm a software engineer based in Barcelona, Spain. I write mostly Python, either in Django or using its Data Science stack.</p>

<p>I work for a <a href="https://a9.ga/">small startup</a> that's working on automating invoicing for financial advisors. In the evening, I mentor Data Science students at <a href="https://thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a>.</p>

<p>I spent 3 years in London working as a Digital Consultant at <a href="https://capco.com/">Capco</a> and as a Data Scientist at <a href="https://octopuslabs.com/">Octopus Labs</a>.</p>

<p>My background is in theoretical Physics. I also hold a master's degree in International Finance.</p>

<p>I love teaching. And reading.</p>
