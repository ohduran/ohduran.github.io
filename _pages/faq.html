<h3>The short version</h3>
<p class="pb-3">I've been a Digital Consultant, a Data Scientist and a Software Engineer. I <a href="/email">don't usually respond to email</a>. I was born in Madrid, been living in London for 3 years, and I'm currently in Barcelona.</p>

<h3>The long version</h3>
<p class="pb-3">You can find it in my <a href="/contact">contact page</a>, and a structured version in my <a href="/resume">resume page</a>.</p>

<p class="pb-3">I don't read most of my email, so that I can focus on what's really important. Following some <a href="/email">sensible guidelines</a> will get you my undivided attention.</p>
