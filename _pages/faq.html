<h3>The short version</h3>
<p class="pb-3">I've been a Digital Consultant, a Data Scientist and a Software Engineer. I <a href="/email">don't usually respond to email</a>. I was born in Madrid, been living in London for 3 years, and I'm currently in Barcelona.</p>

<h3>The long version</h3>
<p class="pb-3">You can find it in <a href="/mystory">my story</a>, and a structured version in my <a href="/resume">resume page</a>.</p>

<h3>Should I learn how to code?</h3>
<p>It depends. Code is just a language, a particular one by which you communicate things to the computer. You may learn how to give it orders, but in the end it will do exactly as you tell it. True mastery comes from understanding how a computer works. For starters, read <a href="/code-hidden-language-of-computer">Code, The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software</a>, by Charles Petzold.</p>
<p class="pb-3">On the other hand, there are so many professions that are going to be affected by technology— or are in the process— that is unlikely that anyone will be able to do without some basic coding skills in the foreseeable future.</p>

<h3>"I want to get into the habit of reading, but everytime I try, I grow bored of it".</h3>
<p >I get it. Humans are wired to <a href="/being-bored">being bored</a>. But that's because you're reading without a purpose, without trying to answer any question that you may have.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Cat: Where are you going?
    Alice: Which way should I go?
    Cat: That depends on where you are going.
    Alice: I don’t know.
    Cat: Then it doesn’t matter which way you go.”</p>
  <p>― <strong>Lewis Carroll</strong>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9176374483/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=9176374483&linkCode=as2&tag=alvaroduran-20&linkId=4b0609b0bd4b2cd3743eb3b5a791ca3c">Alice in Wonderland</a></p>

<p class="pb-3">You should probably read <a href="/start-reading">this guide</a> that I put together with some advice on relearning how to read.</p>

<h3>How do you monetise this site?</h3>

Affiliate revenues come from Amazon: when you buy a book via any link on this site, I collect a small commission.</p>
