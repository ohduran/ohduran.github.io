I find that reading is more fulfilling when you focus on the quality of your reading instead of your quantity. That's why you'll find me digging into books to find answers to my questions. How can I communicate my ideas better? Why is the political landscape so polarised? What is war really like?

You'll find my notes below, ordered by topic. Some books covered different topics, and thus they belong to several sections at the same time!

Read these notes like any other article in this website: a thorough look, but also a personal one, unlike any other book reviews that I've seen elsewhere.

Hope you enjoy it.
