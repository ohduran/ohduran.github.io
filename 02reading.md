Like Groucho, I find television very educating: every time somebody turns on the set, I go into the other room and read a book.

That's why you'll find me digging into books, to figure out answers to my questions: *How can I communicate my ideas better? Why is the political landscape so polarised? What is war really like?*

It's the only way I have found to call the author up on the phone whenever I felt like it. They're not sneak peeks at what the book is all about, but what came of my experience with it, without any time constraints.

I really hope that you enjoy it, and that you feel part of the conversation.
