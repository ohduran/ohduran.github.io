This journal redraws the sense of a journal. Up until now, they have been written sequentially, and it's primarily time-driven: today I did this, and yesterday I did that, and tomorrow always comes after today. Once an entry has been written, we may read it over the course of the day it was written, but then we forget about it, and we never read it again, unless we are reminded. These are the basis in which most blog sites and even most social media apps are built: perishability pervades every pixel of it.

That is not the case in this journal. This journal aims at including a small amount of essays with an aim to be timeless. Not in the Roman sense, though, not granitic, immutable, but robust in the Taleb's sense.

> The fragility of the systemâ€™s components (provided they are renewable and replaceable) is required to ensure the solidity of the system as a whole. If humans were immortals, they would have gone extinct from an accident, or from a gradual buildup of mistiness. Shorter shelf life for humans allows genetic changes across generations to be in sync with the variability of the environment.

Thus, these essays are constantly evolving, updating, upgrading themselves to be better, and to resist the test of time. You won't find clickbait here: that is as fragile as can be.

My name is Alvaro Duran-Barata. I am a problem solver, a curious mind, a lifelong learner.

### A brief history
- *2006*: As a high school student, I discover Physics for the first time. It extends Mathematics to the everyday life, and aims to answer all those questions about the world we live in. I start working on those questions from a different, more entrepreneurial perspective.

- *2009*: After disabusing myself from studying Philosophy, I get accepted as a Physics student, where I meet the smartest people I know. During my senior year, one professor discusses the potential uses of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics in predicting stock market fluctuations. That piqued my interest: so many questions unanswered, and a focus on "whatever works" regardless of the principles behind. So much work to do.

- *2015*: I complete my master's degree in Finance with an statistical analysis of the implications of Quantitative Easing. I then move to London. I will spend the next 3 years working in fintech environments, learning about the current trend in technologies and specialising in Data Science and Deep Learning.

- *2018*: Moved back to Spain and accepted a position as a Software Engineer for a small SaaS fintech company.

### Where you can find me
