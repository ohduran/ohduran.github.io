The first time I learnt about the "Efficient Market Hypothesis", I probably laughed out loud. Economists have an annoying tendency to wrap simple thoughts in complex jargon. It felt a lot like giving up on an interesting problem before even start. "Markets know better" sounds a lot like "We didn't try hard enough". Smarter people than me must have already come to the conclusion that, although everyone has access to the same information, it's  the importance that each agent places on each piece of insight what makes markets inefficient.

My name is Alvaro Duran and I've been attracted by interesting problems since I was a kid, specially those that challenged the common wisdom. I graduated in Physics pursuing these challenges, and gravitated toward finance and economics when I realised that the "standard model" of the business world was, paraphrasing Bill Byrson, a mountain of theory built on a molehill of evidence. After passing my master's degree in International Finance, I started working as a Digital Consultant for several Financial institutions, with a focus on how they interact with the end customer. This only strengthen my vision that there is so much left to do.

Technology wise, I learnt MATLAB when I was an undergraduate, along with some common algorithms in C++ for differential equations. After that, I moved to Python and I have used it for pretty much everything I've done since: mostly Data Science (pandas, numpy, matplotlib), but also Web development (Lots of Flask, both as monolithic web applications and also as microservices). I am recurrently appalled by the code I wrote 6 months before, hence I approach coding with an emphasis on readability and loose coupling, so that:
a) I spend the least amount of time maintaining the code base.
b) If I have to refactor something, I would clearly understand what is going on at first glance.

If we think alike, I want to hear about you. If we don't, I absolutely want to hear about you.

### Technology

This site is powered by Jekyll. That's because:
- I can write in Markdown.
- I can pretty much forget about setting everything up.

If you haven't heard of Jekyll before, you can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/), and find the source code for the Jekyll new theme at:
