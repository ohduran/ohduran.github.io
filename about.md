My name is Alvaro Duran-Barata. I am a problem solver, a curious mind, a lifelong learner, a challenge accepter.

### A short story
- *2006*: As a high school student, I discover Physics for the first time. It extends Mathematics to the everyday life, and aims to answer all those silly questions about the world we live in. I start working on those questions from a different, much more entrepreneurial perspective.

- *2009*: After disabusing myself from studying Philosophy, I get accepted as a Physics student, where I meet the smartest people I know. During my senior year, one professor discusses the potential uses of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics in predicting stock market fluctuations. That, and the investigation that followed, lead me into Finance.

- *2015*: I complete my master's degree in Finance with an statistical analysis of the implications of Quantitative Easing. Move to London and accept an offer to join a management consultant firm called Capco, specialised in Financial Services.

- *2017*: After working as a Digital Consultant for Bradesco and HSBC, I join one of the biggest venture capital firms in the UK, called Octopus, as a Data Scientist.
