I'm a physicist that loves pizza, staring at the same painting in a museum for ages and listen to [generative music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_music).

For the past {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus: 2014 }} years, I've worked in a vast range of areas related to Digital businesses: build websites, optimise databases, design software architecture, do machine learning research, you name it.

I love creating things from scratch, and I believe that people should feel boredom more often.

Feel free to [contact me](/#contact) if you want to know more.
