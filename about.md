My name is Alvaro Duran-Barata. I am a problem solver, a curious mind, a lifelong learner, a challenge accepter.

### A short story
- *2006*: As a high school student, I discover Physics for the first time. It extends Mathematics to the everyday life, and aims to answer all those questions about the world we live in. I start working on those questions from a different, more entrepreneurial perspective.

- *2009*: After disabusing myself from studying Philosophy, I get accepted as a Physics student, where I meet the smartest people I know. During my senior year, one professor discusses the potential uses of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics in predicting stock market fluctuations. That piqued my interest: so many questions unanswered, and a focus on "whatever works" regardless of the principles behind. So much work to do.

- *2015*: I complete my master's degree in Finance with an statistical analysis of the implications of Quantitative Easing. I then move to London. I will spend the next 3 years working in fintech environments, learning about the current trend in technologies and specializing in Data Science and Deep Learning.

- *2018*: Moved back to Spain and accepted a position as a Software Engineer for a small SaaS fintech company.
